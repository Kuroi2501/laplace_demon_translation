Fracture into the door.{02}I hear a {79}click{7a} and then{03}
the door opens.{02}{00}{aa}

There's an old man with{03}
friendly eyes.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{000031c3}
Laplace believed the world{03}
and all in it was made of{03}
math, and thus measurable.{02}He also felt he played an{03}
important role in all this,{02}to know and control the{03}
calculations of the world{03}
that others could not.{02}Eventually, he realized{03}
the role he had wished.{02}To further those ends, he{03}
summoned Laplace's Demon.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{000031c6}
Perhaps you can save Master{03}
Laplace. Let me give you{03}
this to help.{02}The old man took out a{03}
staff made of crystal.{02}Hyaline Iris acquired.{02}{00}{aa}

Laplace's Demon has no{03}
concept of good and evil.{02}It simply answers to{03}
Laplace's wishes and{03}
desires.{02}Master Laplace fears that{03}
Benedict may be able to{03}
control the demon as well.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------

You might be able to save{03}
Master Laplace. I'll give{03}

{000031e4}
A very tired old man sits{03}
on the throne before me.{02}I can sense great power{03}
behind his eyes,{02}but there's much madness{03}
inside there as well. This{03}
can only be Laplace{75}{02}{01}{11}{79}More intruders from earth's{03}
twentieth century, I see.{02}Whatever you're planning,{03}
it will fail. Go home.{7a}{02}{01} {00}{aa}

droll you are, giving{03}
commands to a monarch.{02}You'll never comprehend my{03}
plans for your world.{02}If you wish me stopped,{03}
then stand against me.{02}Should you defeat me, I'll{03}
seal the Elder Sign and{03}
halt the invasion.{02}If I win, your souls are a{03}
sacrifice to the demon.{02}For he has a special power.{02}With your souls it forges{03}
a connection to your world,{03}
extending its power there.{02}In other words, your souls{03}
will serve as its beacon.{02}So, what will it be{76}{02}My prophetic powers cannot{03}
affect you, so we fight on{03}
equal terms. Shall we{76}{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{000031ea}
{01}{11}I'm defeated. Laplace's{03}
Demon could not foretell{03}
the victor.{02}For the first time, I have{03}
found something the perfect{03}
demon could not divine.{02}{01} {00}{aa}

{01}{11}You're worried that the{03}
Demon is dangerous{76}{02}It is under my control{75}{03}
