There is a cavity in the{03}
statue's chest suggesting{03}
something is missing.{02}{00}{aa}

I place the doll's heart{03}
into the chest cavity.{02}Nearby, the flow of water{03}
trickles to a stop.{02}{00}{aa}

and with fiery hair.{02}It holds a box in its right{03}
hand and a wine cup in its{03}
left.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002da3}
It seems there's some sort{03}
of mechanism in the left-{03}
hand wine glass.{02}It's like a crucible for{03}
melting or burning.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002da6}

up.{02}{00}{aa}

A mysterious painting of a{03}
space filled with purple{03}
mist hangs on the wall.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002db5}
I looked at the painting,{03}
and saw something move out{03}
of the corner of my eye.{02}The eyeball of a strange{03}
creature had just shifted.{02}I watched as its feelers{03}
began to warp and stretch.{02}Suddenly, they crept right{03}
off the painting at me{75}{02}But I was too quick and the{03}
strange feelers wrapped up{03}
nothing but empty space.{02}After examining it from a{03}
distance, I believe that{03}
plenty of the characters{02}weren't painted at all, but{03}
dragged in like I almost{03}
was.{02}{00}{aa}

{00002ddf}
I don't believe we've met{03}
before, have we{76}{02}What odd attire. Did{03}
Moldiv summon you,{03}
perhaps{76}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002de2}
Why, I never{75}{02}The ghostly figure suddenly{03}
vanishes.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002de5}
To judge me by my face so{03}
is unfair and quite{03}
unbecoming.{02}From the looks of your{03}
clothes, you must be a{03}
friend of Benedict's.{02}Now if you'll excuse me, I{03}
suddenly feel a bit faint.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002de8}
Who are you{76} Stay out of{03}
my way{75}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002deb}
The nerve{75}{02}The ghostly figure up and{03}
vanishes.{02}{00}{aa}

{00002dee}
So my expression offends{03}
you, does it{76} How very{03}
intolerant of you.{02}Your garb tells me you know{03}
Benedict, so I will assume{03}
you are his friend.{02}You rub me the wrong way,{03}
so just leave me alone.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002df1}
Were you also summoned{03}
here as guests of Sir{03}
Laplace{76}{02}He should be on the top{03}
floor of the castle.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002df4}
How terribly rude of you{75}{02}The ghostly figure suddenly{03}
vanishes.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002df7}
You could stand to be less{03}
judgmental of my face.{02}I gave my flesh willingly{03}
to Moldiv's magic,{02}and now, as a spirit, I{03}
have true freedom.{02}This is my eternal life, a{03}
boon from Moldiv{75}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002dfa}
I haven't seen Miss{03}
Cassandra for some time,{03}
I'm afraid.{02}Nor the knight Bayard, for{03}
that matter. Has something{03}
happened to them{76}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002dfd}
How rude{75}{02}The ghostly figure just{03}
vanishes.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e00}
My face should be no cause{03}
for fright.{02}Moldiv's magic took my{03}
flesh from me, but{02}gave me true freedom as a{03}
spirit in return.{02}I give thanks every day for{03}
the life he gave me{75}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e03}
On the 2nd floor of the{03}
castle...{02}... a beast called a{03}
gryphon has taken up{03}
residence.{02}I hear he is hiding a{03}
mysterious item.{02}Someone else was looking{03}
for it, too...{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e06}
How vulgar of you{75}{02}The ghostly figure just{03}
disappears.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e09}
What's wrong{76} Why such{03}
alarmed expressions{76}{03}
What strange people...{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e0c}
I hear that Laplace stays{03}

{00002e0f}
How rude{75}{02}The ghostly figure vanishes{03}
from sight.{02}{00}{aa}

There's a silver bell in{03}
the drawer.{02}Silver Bell acquired.{02}{00}{aa}

{00002e21}
Damn, the bell seems to be{03}
broken{75} It won't ring.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e24}
The servant here seems to{03}
be rather a bit shocked to{03}
see me.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e27}
Are you by any chance one{03}
of Benedict's friends{76}{03}
I'm sure I'm not mistaken.{02}If it's him you seek, then{03}
look for him in a cell.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e2a}
The man scurries off,{03}
looking quite frightened.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e2d}
And just as conversation{03}
ended, in walks a guard.{02}Intruders{75} Come quietly{75}{02}{00}{aa}

There's a map inside the{03}

My, he looks tired.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e39}
The man scurries off,{03}
looking quite frightened.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e3c}
What do you want{76} My head{03}
is pounding, I can't get{03}
any sleep...{02}At night, I can hear moans{03}
coming up from the floor,{03}
and I just can't sleep.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e3f}
Leave me alone. My head{03}
hurts.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e42}
This man really needs help,{03}
so I patch him up with some{03}
medicine.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e45}
Until just recently I'd{03}
hear strange voices at{03}
night.{02}But lately they've stopped{03}
so I can finally sleep.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e48}
We finish talking and a{03}
a guard walks in.{02}Intruders{75} Come quietly{75}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e4b}
A man in an adorned robe is{03}
here.{02}He smiles kindly as he{03}
notices my presence, and{03}
approaches.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e4e}
We are on the same side,{03}
you and I.{02}{00}{aa}

guests here.{02}I was about to have dinner.{03}
Care to join me{76}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e54}
I see. What a pity.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e57}
Make yourselves at home.{02}We ate dinner and relaxed.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e5a}
Several days ago a woman{03}
dressed like you lot showed{03}
up here for a talk.{02}We had a nice chat.{02}Her name was Joanna.{02}But then guards came and{03}
knocked her unconscious, so{03}
I do hope she's okay...{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e5d}
But what troubles Master{03}
Laplace concerns me more.{02}From when Benedict arrived{03}
his majesty has been in a{03}
murderous fugue.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e60}
In the southwest part of{03}
the basement is a prison.{02}It's where King Laplace{03}
puts people who he just{03}
wants to forget about.{02}Perhaps Joanna is also{03}
being imprisoned there.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002e63}
Well if it isn't Joanna{75}{02}I'd heard that you were{03}
captured by the guards. So{03}
nice to see you again.{02}{00}{aa}

{00002eae}
Is that Benedict{76}{03}
Why is he here{76}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002eb1}
It appears Master Laplace{03}
is afraid of something.{02}Just why is that{76} Does it{03}
have to do with Benedict,{03}
who escaped{76}{02}{00}{aa}

------------------
{00002ecc}
I see, oh well.{02}{01} {00}{aa}

{00002ecf}
There's a man. He's sighing{03}
as if there's something{03}
that worries him.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002ed2}
Well, if it isn't Ryan.{02}Anita was taken away by a{03}
monster living in the{03}
cemetery by the lake.{02}If you go up the stairs to{03}
the east you should be able{03}
to catch up with them.{02}You should hurry{75}{02}{00}{aa}

My master is not at home,{02}for he has been imprisoned{03}
in a cell for trying to save{03}
a pointless little girl.{02}{00}{aa}

That man I let out of a{03}
jail cell.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f17}
Adolph's here.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f1a}
What are you doing{76}{75}{03}
It's me, Adolph.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f1d}
Oh, if it isn't {04}{00}.{03}
I'm Adolph.{02}I haven't forgotten my debt{03}
to you for getting me out{03}
of that stinking pit.{02}Did you meet a magician{03}
named Moldiv{76}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f20}
You defeated Moldiv{76}{03}
Excellent{75}{02}It was his influence that{03}
led King Laplace down the{03}
path of darkness.{02}It was he who summoned the{03}
Demon to this castle.{02}It seems that he taught the{03}
King his summoning, for now{03}
they gather a host of{02}creatures to invade your{03}
world.{02}The Crystaline Fracture{03}
Moldiv had is the key to{03}
the 2nd floor.{02}We must see the King before{03}
it's too late.{02}We must nullify his pact{03}
with the Demon, or the{03}
damned thing will surely{02}devour both your world and{03}
mine.{02}His Majesty must be saved{03}
somehow. I want what is{03}
truly best for him.{02}I cannot come with you,{03}
but please be careful.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f23}
Just like me, Moldiv is{03}
an adept in the service of{03}
King Laplace.{02}He was also who summoned{03}
Laplace his Demon.{02}And the other monsters all{03}
gathered together here for{03}
invading your world.{02}I tried to expose his evil{03}
deeds but was defeated.{02}Instead of being killed, I{03}
was imprisoned.{02}We must see King Laplace{03}
as soon as we are able.{02}We will nullify his pact{03}
with the Demon.{02}Before he uses the thing to{03}
devour this little world,{03}
and your big one.{02}But in order to go above{03}
even the first floor you'll{02}need the Crystaline Fracture{03}
kept by that fiend,{03}
Moldiv.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f26}
I'm thinking of defeating{03}
Moldiv. Try it with me{76}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f29}
Let's work together and{03}
defeat Moldiv.{02}Adolph the wizard joined{03}
the party.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f2c}
I see. Well then, take{03}
care. Moldiv is a scary{03}
enemy.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f2f}
I'm thinking of defeating{03}
Moldiv.{02}But with just my powers, I{03}
cannot defeat him.{02}Please assist me some time.{03}
I will be waiting here.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f32}
{04}{00}, how goes the{03}
investigation{76}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f35}
In the castle there are{03}
places surrounded by things{03}
like lakes and forests.{02}Space has been distorted by{03}
extremely powerful magic.{03}
Please be careful.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f38}
I'm thinking of defeating{03}
Moldiv.{02}But with just my strength,{03}
I cannot defeat him. Please{03}
aid me if you can.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f3b}
Sir {04}{00}, I will{03}
return to the princess.{02}Moldiv is a fearsome foe.{03}
Be careful.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f3e}
You're going to fight{03}
Moldiv{76}{02}There's no way I'm going{03}
to do something so{03}
dangerous{75}{02}I'm going to continue{03}
treasure hunting by myself{75}{03}
Bye{75}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f41}
Oh well, I'm going home{03}
by myself. Take care.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f44}
Right now it's more{03}
important to kill Moldiv{03}
with Master Adolph.{02}For now I will be hiding in{03}
the western part of the{03}
first floor courtyard. Bye.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f47}
Defeating Moldiv is more{03}
important than me. I will{03}
return to Newcam.{02}I'll see you in the bar.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f4a}
{01}{10}It seems you've found your{03}
friend. I guess I'll go see{03}
my friend too.{02}We probably won't ever meet{03}
again.{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f4d}
I see. Well then, be{03}
careful. Moldiv is a{03}
powerful enemy.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f50}
I'm thinking of defeating{03}
Moldiv.{02}But with just my powers, I{03}
cannot defeat him.{02}Please return once you've{03}
taken Kenichiro back to{03}
town. Then please help me.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f53}
The door is locked.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f56}
There's a servant. He seems{03}
to be working busily, and{03}
he doesn't notice you.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f59}
The man ran off with a{03}
frightened look.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f5c}
I'm supposed to go clean up{03}
the cell over to the south-{03}
west.{02}It's a room with a pool{03}
used for water torture.{03}
How horrible.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f5f}
If you give me some money I{03}
won't rat you out.{02}I'm friends with Benedict{03}
too, right{76}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f62}
Reluctantly, I decided to{03}
hand the man the money.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f65}
I hear that as punishment{03}
for defying Master Laplace,{02}Princess Cassandra has been{03}
imprisoned somewhere in the{03}
vicinity of the lake.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f68}
If you give me some money I{03}
won't rat you out.{02}I'm friends with Benedict{03}
too, right{76}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f6b}
I hand the money over.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f6e}
There was a small bottle{03}
in the drawer.{02}Cactus Extract acquired.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f71}
Oops. It broke. I kind of{03}
wish I hadn't done that.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f74}
There's a big fat bald{03}
guy just sitting there{03}
and staring at me.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f77}
I got me a bunch of sneak{03}
thieves trying to burgle{03}
up some treasure{75} Ha{75} Ha{75}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f7a}
A large bundle of keys hang{03}
off of his belt.{02}Ring of Keys acquired.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f7d}
There's a servant.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f80}
The man ran off with a{03}
frightened look.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f83}
I saw a man go inside the{03}
lair of that wizard the{03}
other day.{02}When he came out, he had a{03}
strange look on his face.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f86}
When the conversation ended,{03}
a guard appeared.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f89}
There were Digitalis Herbs{03}
in the drawer.{02}Digitalis Herbs acquired.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f8c}
Oh no, it's a trap{75}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f8f}
A shadowy figure lies on{03}
the bed.{02}As I approach it, it lets{03}
out a terrible moan and{03}
leaps at me.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f92}
There was an old gold coin{03}
on the bed.{02}Old Gold Doubloon{03}
acquired.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f95}
There was a small bottle on{03}
the table.{02}Cactus Extract acquired.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f98}
I dropped it and it broke.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f9b}
I tried to examine the doll{03}
but it stood up suddenly,{03}
right on the desk.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002f9e}
Within the broken doll was{03}
an iron heart.{02}Iron Heart of a Doll{03}
acquired.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fa1}
The door is locked.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fa4}
There's a good-looking hunk{03}
of cheese on the table.{02}Ripe Old Cheese acquired.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fa7}
Some of this cheese looks{03}
like it's been chewed on{03}
by rats. I'll pass on this.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002faa}
A guard saw us and started{03}
yelling.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fad}
Who goes there{76}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fb0}
Moldiv's chambers lie to{03}
the southeast, but they{03}
are across the waterway.{02}You'll need to close the{03}
floodgate to drain the{03}
passage of water.{02}I don't really know anymore{03}
details.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fb3}
Hold on there{75}{02}You're the intruders{75}{03}
Come peacefully{75}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fb6}
A huge amount of water{03}
gushes from the statue{03}
standing against the wall.{02}Perhaps the water from the{03}
waterway above is flowing{03}
into it.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fb9}
There is a Lunar Charm on{03}
the table.{02}Lunar Charm acquired.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fbc}
But the Lunar Charm is{03}
broken and isn't usable.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fbf}
There is a bottle on the{03}
bed.{02}Remedy acquired.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fc2}
... aaaaaand I broke it.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fc5}
I check out a book.{02}Mythos knowhow blasts into{03}
my brain, nearly making me{03}
vomit.{02}Learned {79}Mythos Desecration{7a}{03}
invocation.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fc8}
Something jumped out at me{75}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fcb}
There's a young man wearing{03}
a robe.{02}His cold eyes sends chills{03}
down my spine as I stare{03}
at them.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fce}
{01}{14}How rude, attacking out{03}
of the blue like that{75}{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fd1}
His cold stare stays my{03}
hand somehow. I can't{03}
move to attack him{75}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fd4}
{01}{14}Are you friends of{03}
Benedict{76}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fd7}
{01}{14}My name is Louvain. I am{03}
Benedict's... assistant.{02}You insist you are his{03}
friends{76}{02}He is being held prisoner{03}
by the lake. Go free him.{02}Be warned, though{75} His{03}
prison is being guarded{03}
by quite a monster indeed.{02}I'd wager you need a{03}
talisman to vanquish it.{02}Moldiv's pet just so{03}
happens to have such a{03}
talisman southeast of here.{02}Take it off its corpse.{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fda}
{01}{14}Then you have no business{03}
here. Leave now.{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fdd}
{01}{14}Isn't that Benedict{76}{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fe0}
{01}{0e}Help me, Louvain{75} These{03}
are our enemies{75}{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fe3}
Breaking free {04}{00}{03}
and the others, Benedict{03}
rushed over to the wizard.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fe6}
{01}{14}Enemies you say{76}{02}Well, I'd know just what to{03}
do with my enemies if I had{03}
any, heh heh.{02}Perhaps I'll show you, just{03}
to see your true strength.{02}{01} Louvain's form shifts to a{03}
demon as he attacks{76}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fe9}
{01}{14}Not bad. You can at least{03}
kill Benedict for me.{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fec}
{01}{0e}So you're turning on me{03}
at last, Louvain{76}{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00002fef}
{01}{14}Yes, I think now's the{03}
perfect time for betrayal.{02}So, brave ones from{03}
another world, perhaps we{03}
shall meet again,{02}but it's goodbye for now.{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00002ff2}
The wizard vanishes, and{03}
Benedict agrees to talk.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00002ff5}
{01}{00}What is the deal with that{03}
Louvain guy{76}{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00002ff8}
{01}{01}Just what is up with that{03}
Louvain guy{76}{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00002ffb}
{01}{0e}... Let's talk after we've{03}
returned to Newcam.{02}It'd be best to escape this{03}
world now.{02}If we're caught by Laplace,{03}
we'll be tortured and then{03}
killed.{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00002ffe}
There's a guard.{02}Stop right there{75}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003001}
The guard had a cell key.{02}Cell Key acquired.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003004}
There's a guard.{02}Stop right there{75}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003007}
The door is locked.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{0000300a}
What are you doing{76}{03}
Wait just a minute.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{0000300d}
I see a man robed in dark{03}
cloth.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003010}
{01}{0b}My name is Adolph. Have{03}
you come to my rescue{76}{02}Moldiv caught me in one{03}
of his magical traps.{02}He's been manipulating{03}
Master Laplace ever since{03}
he arrived.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003013}
I plan to slay Moldiv in{03}
order to save my lord from{03}
his villainous clutches.{02}Please join me now in{03}
defeating him{75}{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00003016}
{01}{0b}Good. We begin our search{03}
in the Southeast on this{03}
floor.{02}Moldiv was key to the{03}
demon's summoning. Do not{03}
take his power lightly.{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00003019}
{01}{0b}I see. I could still use{03}
your help though.{02}So if you change your mind,{03}
please come to my room and{03}
talk to me.{02}I'm at the room on the{03}
northeast of this floor.{03}
I'll see you later.{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{0000301c}
{01}{0b}I'd like your help in{03}
saving Master Laplace.{02}Please come see me when{03}
you're ready.{02}I'll be on the northeast{03}
room of this floor. I'll{03}
see you there.{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{0000301f}
A tall, gallant man is{03}
standing here. He bears a{03}
knightly countenance.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003022}
Do not address me so.{02}I, Ser Bayard, will not{03}
stand for such disrespect{75}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003025}
{01}{0d}I am Ser Bayard, servant to{03}
the Lady Cassandra, and{03}
a knight of Laplace Castle.{02}I seek a man named{03}
Kenichiro.{02}If you have seen him, you{03}
must tell me.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003028}
My charge is to rescue this{03}
man before I may return to{03}
Lady Cassandra's side.{02}I require your aid. You{03}
must assist me{75}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{0000302b}
{01}{0d}You have my gratitude.{02}He was betrayed by a man{03}
named Benedict, and caught.{02}I know not his fate, he may{03}
be jailed or worse.{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{0000302e}
{01}{0d}I see. I pray we meet{03}
again, for all our sake.{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00003031}
{01}{0d}I shall stay at Lady{03}
Cassandra's side for now.{02}I'm certain our paths will{03}
cross again. Take care.{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00003034}
{01}{0d}Oh, if it isn't Sir{03}
Kenichiro{75}{02}A pleasure to see you again{03}
so soon. Lady Cassandra's{03}
been worried about you.{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00003037}
{01}{03}
Sorry for worrying you. Is{03}
Princess Cassandra alright{76}{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{0000303a}
{01}{0d}Nary have I heard from her{03}
ere your capture, so I{03}
cannot say for certain.{02}But seeing that you are{03}
well, I shall return to{03}
inform her immediately.{02}Please excuse me.{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{0000303d}
A small pool of clear water.{03}
A number of shining objects{03}
lie at the bottom.{02}Maybe it seems like a good{03}
idea to try fishing these{03}
out{76}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003040}
A pool of acid. Great.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003043}
The wounds on this corpse{03}
are so fresh that they're{03}
still bleeding.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003046}
Looking at the corpse of a{03}
torture victim accidentally{03}
makes me nauseated.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003049}
The wrack is reddish brown.{02}It has been stained by the{03}
blood of countless victims{03}
of the King's Executioner.{02}The thing is the kind of{03}
dirty that doesn't wash{03}
out.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{0000304c}
Who disturbs my slumber{75}{76}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{0000304f}
A dead oriental.{02}His torso is covered by{03}
countless bleeding wounds{03}
probably issued in torture.{02}The body has essentially{03}
been slashed to ribbons.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003052}
The sight of the oriental{03}
man's corpse seems to make{03}
Benedict anxious.{02}He protests the danger, and{03}
wants to return to town.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003055}
{79}People who came from the{03}
American town of Newcam,{03}
am I correct{76}{02}I am Kenichiro Kusakabe.{02}I sought to thwart Benedict{03}
but I was captured and then{03}
tortured to death.{02}Benedict's plan is to take{03}
control of the King's Demon{03}
and revive his dead mother.{02}That is a foolish act.{02}Benedict must be captured{03}
and his plan stopped, even{03}
if it means killing him.{02}I may have means to assist{03}
you if you can return here{03}
with a vial of holy water.{7a}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003058}
{01}{0d}Sir Kenichiro{75}{02}What horrifying atrocities{03}
befell you in this{03}
wretched pit{75}{76}{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{0000305b}
{79}Sir Bayard{76} Is Princess{03}
Cassandra safe{76}{7a}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{0000305e}
{01}{0d}Well... I left the{03}
Princess shortly after{03}
you were captured, so...{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003061}
{01} {79}I see...{02}I hope she doesn't get into{03}
any danger for protecting{03}
me...{7a}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003064}
Something strange happened{03}
when I anointed the body{03}
with holy water.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003067}
Wounds all over the beaten{03}
corpse began closing up as{03}
if by magic.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{0000306a}
Realized 2000 experience.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{0000306d}
{01} Arigato. I am still very{03}
weak, but I will survive.{02}We should return to your{03}
city for now.{02}Shall we go right now{76}{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003070}
Thinking about Kenichiro's{03}
health, I returned to{03}
Newcam.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003073}
Oh well. You probably{03}
have things you need to{03}
do too.{02}But please return as fast{03}
as possible to Newcam.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003076}
{01}{0b}Kenichiro... he sure seems{03}
to be an excellent wielder{03}
of magic.{02}I guess I'll return to my{03}

I looked on stoically as{03}
Moldiv breathed his last.{02}{00}{aa}

Adolph.{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00003169}
{01}{0b}No, I cannot do that. He is{03}
still my liege, and I am as{03}
much his thrall as anyone.{02}On his command, I would{03}
turn my hand against you.{02}I cannot bring myself to{03}
defy him.{02}{01} {00}{aa}

Realized 3000 experience.{02}{00}{aa}
------------------
{00003181}
{01}{15}I... misjudged you...{02}Tell Benedict...{02}Tell him that Laplace's{03}
Demon is beyond anyone's{03}
power to control.{02}Even Laplace himself is{03}
under its thrall.{02}Perhaps even now, I am{03}
serving its ends, always{03}
ever a piece on the board.{02}{01} {00}{aa}
------------------
{00003184}
I looked on objectively as{03}
