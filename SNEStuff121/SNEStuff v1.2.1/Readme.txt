========================

SNEStuff is a tool inspired by FuSoYa, byuu, and Ersanio.
It contains a an address converter like Lunar Address, a
ROM expander like Lunar Expand (expansion for beyond 4 megs
is still WIP), an IPS patcher like Lunar IPS, an ASM patcher
using xkas v0.06, and a color converter like Ersanio's HDMA
color converter.

The Addresser:
Works very much like Lunar Address. Also has descriptions on
how the addressing modes work.

The Expander:
Expands ROMs up to 4MB. Expansion beyond that will come later.
Can also add or remove heades from ROMs and automatically backup
your ROM.

The IPS Patcher:
Can create and apply IPS patches. The IPS patcher works as
efficiently as Luanr IPS's algorithm. The patcher also has
the ability to patch IPS patches to ROMs with or without
headers. Also, the patches made are still compatible with
Lunar IPS. A feature to auto-backup your ROM is included too.

The ASM patcher:
Uses xkas v0.06 and can patch ROMs with spaces if you want too.
Support for incbin/incsrc is included. A feature to patch as a
new ROM is also included.

The color converter:
Inspired by Ersanio's HDMA color converter. I've added a few
modifications to my own version for easier user interaction.
Can also convert between PC colors as well.

A persnonal note:
I know I'm not creative. You may think I'm lame for basically
repackaging 5 tools like this. If you don't like it, you're
free to not use it.
