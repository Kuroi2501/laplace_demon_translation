Louvain, who joked at the{03}
tragedy born from Laplace's{03}
death.{00}
------------------
{00001a02}
So much pain and loss, all{03}
for a 'perfect' future.{00}
------------------
{00001a05}
Laplace's Demon is a horrid{03}
thing, its omnipotent power{03}
not meant to be, but...{00}
------------------
{00001a08}
Those who would use it to{03}
further their own ends are{03}
all the more monstrous.{00}
------------------
{00001a0b}
I look outside and see the{03}
town of Newcam becoming{03}
itself again,{00}
------------------
{00001a0e}
just like the quiet days{03}
of yesteryear.{00}
------------------
{00001a11}
But the future is beyond{03}
our knowledge now.{00}
------------------
{00001a14}
And that uncertainty is{03}
what makes life worth{03}
living.{00}
------------------
{00001a17}
We decided to end our{03}
investigation.{00}
------------------
{00001a1a}
Time to put this weirdness{03}
behind us and move on.{00}

Benedict and Laplace's{03}
Demon may be gone now,{03}
{00}
------------------
{00001a23}
but many more evils lurk{03}
in the dark corners of{03}
this world...{00}
------------------
{00001a26}
Kenichiro smiled.{00}
------------------
{00001a29}
Perhaps one day we'll face{03}
such evils together again.{03}
Farewell. {06}{06}{06}{06}{06}{01} {00}
------------------
{00001a2c}
I awaken to find myself{03}
standing in the town of{03}
Newcam.{00}
------------------
{00001a2f}
Weathertop's Elder Sign has{03}
lost its power.{00}
------------------
{00001a32}
The connection between two{03}
worlds has been severed.{00}
------------------
{00001a35}
It looks like we returned{03}
peace to Newcam. Then,{03}
several years later...{00}
------------------
{00001a38}
Kenichiro stayed behind.{00}
------------------
{00001a3b}
A few years went by...{00}
------------------
{00001a3e}
Newcam was destroyed by an{03}
unbelievably strong storm.{00}
------------------
{00001a41}
I received a photograph of{03}
the storm along with a note{03}
which read{a2} To {04}{00}
------------------
{00001a44}
'The signs are right.{00}
------------------
{00001a47}
The conflict with Laplace's{03}
Demon is about to start{03}
anew. You are needed.{00}

Newcam, Massachusetts, 1924{03}
A seaport just outside the{03}
city of Boston.{00}
------------------
{00001a83}
A town like nowhere special{03}
that was once the setting{03}
for something terrible.{00}
------------------
{00001a86}
Three kids had gone missing{03}
while exploring an old house{03}
said to be haunted... there{03}
was an immediate search.{00}
------------------
{00001a89}
Two boys' bodies were found{03}
mutilated{a8} the girl Amy was{03}
gone without a trace.{00}
------------------
{00001a8c}
The police search turned up{03}
nothing, and all newspaper{03}
inquiries fell flat.{00}
------------------
{00001a8f}
Without the presence of any{03}
clues, the mystery only{03}
deepened.{00}
------------------
{00001a92}
With the whereabouts of the{03}
house's owner unknown, it was{03}
eventually just sealed.{00}
------------------
{00001a95}
I believe that coming here,{03}
to Newcam, is my chance to{03}
{00}
------------------
{00001a98}
solve these murders so that{03}
the families can be at peace.{00}
------------------
{00001a9b}
find Amy, and catch the{03}
scoop of a lifetime.{00}
