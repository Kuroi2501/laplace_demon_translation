{000020da}
One of the rooms in this{03}
wing is inaccessible from{03}
this floor.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000020dd}
Did you get the key{76}{03}
It should be in the Master{03}
Bedroom...{02}
{00}
------------------
{000020e0}
The chapel is no longer a{03}
place for prayer.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000020e3}
The bell is somehow sealed,{03}
as if by magic{75}{02}
You should give it a rest.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000020e6}
The mirror has the power of{03}
spiritual purification,{02}
but it has been corrupted.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000020e9}
I hear that a room in{03}
the west wing is blocked{03}
because it holds a secret.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000020ec}
You had better be afraid if{03}
our King finds you.{02}
Go now, your secret is{03}
safe with me.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000020ef}
The south wing is now the{03}
lair of a necromancer named{03}
Moldiv.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000020f2}
To the southwest, our Lord{03}
keeps an oubliette full of{03}
the forgotten.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000020f5}
There used to be another{03}
one like Moldiv in the{03}
north wing,{03}
{02}
but I forget where he{03}
is anymore.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000020f8}
Take caution to avoid the{03}
chamber all the way south{7d}{7d}{03}
if you don't want to die.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000020fb}
A man from the Far East was{03}
captured, and is now being{03}
tortured.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000020fe}
A man named Louvain lives{03}
in the west wing...{02}
He's very mysterious.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002101}
Use all of your strength.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002104}
The statue by the waterway{03}
is missing its heart.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002107}
Moldiv has mythos powers{03}
that prevents anyone from{03}
going up the stairs.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000210a}
Faces hide pain and madness{03}
brought on by the hell of{03}
endless ballroom dancing.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000210d}
Many of the paintings up in{03}
the southwest gallery are{03}
worth the time to observe.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002110}
It seems there's a device{03}
in the flaming statue.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002113}
If you continue any further{03}
you will die.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002116}
You must pass through every{03}
mirror to find your way out{03}
of the Maze of Mirrors.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002119}
Trying to find your way to{03}
the Maze of Mirrors{76}{02}
Climb up the stairs on the{03}
first floor of the south{03}
wing of the hall.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000211c}
The northern wing has been{03}
covered by some mysterious{03}
growth.{02}
Space has been distorted by{03}
the celestial mechanics of{03}
Laplace's Demon.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000211f}
A wide fissure runs through{03}
the middle of the forest.{02}
Perhaps the old man chemist{03}
will have what you'll need{03}
to get across it.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002122}
A mythical creature that is{03}
half{7d}eagle, half{7d}lion dwells{03}
in the forest to the north.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002125}
West of here is a graveyard{03}
that has become a nest for{03}
man{7d}eating Ghouls.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002128}
The helm will only respond{03}
to one who has a figurehead{03}
and a compass.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000212b}
The menagerie on this floor{03}
contains many exotic types{03}
of animals.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000212e}
A man named Benedict sits{03}
in a locked room nearby.{02}
I cannot show you because{03}
the thing posted to guard{03}
him terrifies me.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002131}
Our Lord has gone so mad{03}
as to imprison his own{03}
daughter, the lovely Lady{02}
Cassandra.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002134}
The witch that lives in the{03}
north wing has gone insane.{02}
Beware her temper, she may{03}
decide to eat you all.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002137}
A girl who wandered here{03}
from another dimension is{03}
going to be sacrificed to{02}
Our Lord.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000213a}
I believe that Our Lord has{03}
finally lost his mind.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000213d}
An audience with Our Lord{03}
requires the Emerald Idol.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002140}
Seek the Sage.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002143}
Seek the Witch...{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002146}
The statue only answers to{03}
Our Lord's commands.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002149}
Just what is happening{76}{03}
Is the world coming to an{03}
end{76}{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000214c}
Try as you might, you can{03}
never return to your world.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000214f}
Our Lord appears disturbed{03}
by Benedict's presence.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002152}
Benedict and Louvain are{03}
conspiring in the castle{03}
undercroft.{02}
Just what are their{03}
schemes{76}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002155}
Our Lord has taken to his{03}
quarters, and won't emerge.{03}
The court is in disarray.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002158}
The inside of the castle is{03}
full of guards. Make sure{03}
not to be spotted.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000215b}
Cassandra is with the Witch{03}
of the lake. Please save{03}
her if you can.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000215e}
I question Louvain's{03}
humanity.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002161}
To have humans here is{03}
quite rare.{02}
Best go home quickly before{03}
madness takes you.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002164}
Time to face your death.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002167}
Show me your best.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000216a}
Welcome to the celestial{03}
realm.{02}
All those lights twinkling{03}
around you are worlds...{03}
worlds almost without end.{02}
Your tiny world is but one{03}
of those lights.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000216d}
This space may appear{03}
infinite to minds like{03}
yours,{02}
but it is but merely a{03}
fraction of infinity.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002170}
For calling forth Laplace's{03}
Demon, this realm shall{03}
be your Hell.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002173}
Louvain occupies the{03}
northern portion of this{03}
realm.{02}
But then, do you even know{03}
which way North is here{76}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002176}
Laplace's Domain has begun{03}
its collapse.{02}
This space will be hurled{03}
into the infinite void.{02}
This is the last chance for{03}
escape.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002179}
{01}{10}Yet more stupid apes come{03}
for pointless violence.{02}
But in your eyes I see{03}
something different{a8}{02}
eyes that have yet to accept{03}
the fate of this doomed{03}
world.{02}
Eyes that see more...{02}
You are ones who deserve to{03}
know the truth.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000217c}
{01}{10}There is no future for this{03}
world. No free will.{02}
All outcomes are known,{03}
predicted by Laplace's{03}
Demon.{02}
Things happen only by my{03}
will and mine alone.{02}
I sought a perfect world,{02}
but what I found was boring{03}
and sterile, devoid of{03}
novelty.{02}
But I can start anew.{02}
This time I will create{03}
perfection.{02}
{01} {00}
