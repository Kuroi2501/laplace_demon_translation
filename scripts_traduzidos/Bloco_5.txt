{0000217f}
The door to that place{03}
creaked shut behind me for{03}
the first time.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002182}
It's impossible to describe{03}
the atmosphere of that{03}
horrible place.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002185}
Hanging on the chain at the{03}
back of the closet is an{03}
amulet.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002188}
Magic Amulet acquired.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000218b}
Fools{75}{75} Leave at once{75}{75}{02}{00}
------------------
{0000218e}
You have been warned.{03}
Leave, before it's too{03}
late{75}{02}{00}
------------------
{00002191}
Benedict's hubris brought{03}
a curse upon this hall.{03}
All its residents, my wife,{02}{00}
------------------
{00002194}
and the servants are its{03}
victims.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002197}
My wife is all I have.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000219a}
In my room, there's a key.{03}
Take it and go to the{03}
chapel.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000219d}
Please lift the curse from{03}
this house. You are the{03}
only ones I can ask.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021a0}
Something shines behind{03}
the dancing flames.{03}
Shall I take it{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{000021a3}
I can feel the flames heat.{03}
Shall I really brave this{03}
intense heat{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{000021a6}
The flames die out.{03}
I found a Silver Ring in{03}
an alcove.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021a9}
A crumpled up piece of{03}
paper. It appears to be a{03}
map for the Hall...{02}{00}
------------------
{000021ac}
Hall 1F Map acquired.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021af}
The dim apparition seemed{03}
to mouth words of urgency,{03}
but vanished before it{02}could convey any meaning.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021b2}
There was a heavy key{03}
within the drawer.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021b5}
There's a musty old book{03}
lying beneath the bed.{03}
It's an old bible.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021b8}
Holy Roman Bible acquired.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021bb}
Something is scrawled{03}
onto the table.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021be}
{79}Humanity's dark nature{03}
has made a home on the{03}
floor above{75}{7a}{02}{00}

------------------
{000021c7}
A book titled{03}
{79}Bestiaries Most Profane{7a}{02}{00}
------------------
{000021ca}
I see the corpse of an{03}
explorer before me.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021cd}
From its neck hangs a{03}
pendant with initials of{03}
L. M. inscribed upon it.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021d0}
The corpse is probably that{03}
of Martin, the man the town{03}
hired to investigate.{02}Should we drag his corpse{03}
back into town{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{000021d3}
And so I ensured his family{03}
that his corpse was laid to{03}
proper rest.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021d6}
A statue atop a fountain{03}
gushes water from the{03}
middle of the lake.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021d9}
The statue resembles the{03}
one seen underground...{02}{00}
------------------
{000021dc}
It might just be my{03}
imagination,{02}but I get the strangest{03}
feeling from this broken{03}
statue...{02}{00}
------------------
{000021df}
There's quite an aged grave{03}
here. It's that of James{03}
Weathertop the First.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021e2}
A molded grave lies here.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021e5}
Smell of upset grave dirt.{03}
This one is still fresh.{02}It belongs to Richard,{03}
late master of the hall.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021e8}
This grave is recent, I can{03}
tell.{02}It belongs to Janet, late{03}
lady of the hall.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021eb}
This headstone is a bit{03}
uneven.{02}When I look closely, it{03}
seems like something dug{03}
its way out of the grave.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021ee}
As I dig deeper, I unearth{03}
nary a coffin, but instead{03}
a lone ring.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021f1}
Memento Ring acquired.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021f4}
All of us then reinterred{03}
the corpse of Lady Janet{03}
Weathertop.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021f7}
Realized {04}{03}
{03}
experience.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021fa}
 gained.{02}{00}
------------------
{000021fd}

star is in the drawer.{02}{00}
------------------

------------------
{0000220c}
The hairs on my neck are{03}
standing up, but why...{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{0000220f}
Help me, {04}{04}.{03}
Suddenly, a dim apparition{03}
appeared...{02}{00}
------------------
{00002212}
So much pain.. I require{02}your aid to lift the curse{03}
corrupting the very walls{03}
of this hall...{02}{00}
------------------
{00002215}
The four Elder Signs...{03}
The spirit then flickers{03}
and vanishes.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002218}
The spirit flickers and{03}
then vanishes.{02}{00}

lies in the drawer.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000221e}
Mirror of Purity acquired.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002221}
This Elder Sign hums with{03}
some strange power, but it{02}appears to be contained for{03}
now, at least...{02}{00}
------------------
{00002224}
Return to Newcam{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{00002227}
This wall appears to be a{03}
new addition.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000222a}
There's a tarnished copper{03}
key in the drawer.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000222d}
Copper Key acquired.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002230}
A female corpse lies atop{03}
the linens.{02}I approach to examine more{03}
closely, and a voice comes{03}
from a dry dead throat...{02}{00}
------------------
{00002233}
I am Janet, Benedict's{03}
mother, and I thank you for{03}
driving out the evil here.{02}My son used forbidden maths{03}
in trying to twist time and{03}
return me to life...{02}{00}
------------------
{00002236}
And those dark equations{03}
wrought upon us all a most{03}
terrible tragedy and woe.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002239}
Benedict has fallen into a{03}
different world from the{03}
Elder Sign in the study...{02}{00}
------------------
{0000223c}
I beg, return my son to me.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000223f}
Benedict has hid a secret{03}
in this small room...{02}{00}
------------------
{00002242}
Perhaps you will find it{03}
useful. Please, take it{03}
with you with my blessing.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002245}
The spirit and the corpse{03}
of lady Janet are here...{02}{00}
------------------
{00002248}
That terrible spirit you{03}
defeated had been sealing{03}
the power of the Holy Bell.{02}But with it gone I can{03}
restore the bell's power,{03}
and you must ring it.{02}Even I can find peace from{03}
the power of that bell if{03}
it be rung.{02}But please, bury my body{03}
in the basement first{75}{02}Without the protection of{03}
the earth around my body,{03}
the bell will destroy me.{02}Incidentally, I caught{03}
Benedict hiding an item in{03}
the small room beside me.{02}Perhaps you will find it{03}
useful. Take it with you,{03}
with my blessings.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000224b}
The corpse of Lady Janet{03}
lies there, still. Shall I{03}
carry it forth{76}{02}{00}

------------------
{00002257}
There is a man crouched in{03}
the center of the room.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000225a}
The crouched man lunges at{03}
me and attacks{75}{02}{00}
------------------
{0000225d}
The man seemed like little{03}
more than a violent bulk.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002260}
My memory is a haze...{03}
but I recall being attacked{03}
by some creature, then...{02}You. Thank you. I must go{03}
back into town with you{75}{02}{00}
------------------
{00002263}
This man is half dead.{03}
I can't abandon him here.{02}{00}
------------------

wiser.{02}{00}

------------------
{0000226f}
The room looks like it was{03}
hit by a freak storm.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002272}
The bed rises in the air,{03}
then flies towards me{75}{02}{00}
------------------
{00002275}
This bed is in tatters.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002278}
This chair is completely{03}
broken.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000227b}
Oh, a broken desk.{02}{00}

Books of the occult, as{03}
well as... books on maths{03}
and sciences{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{00002287}
So many modern texts on{03}
chance and probability{03}
here, but why{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{0000228a}
Many entries are scrawled{03}
in the margins, most about{02}something called Laplace's{03}
Demon...{02}{00}
------------------
{0000228d}
I do believe these are{03}
Salts of Amun in the{03}
drawer.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002290}
Salts of Amun acquired.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002293}
There is a stagnate,{03}
bestial odor that permeates{03}
this room.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002296}

adorned chapel outside by{03}
looking through the window.{02}{00}

------------------
{000022a2}

------------------
{000022a5}
This room is absolutely{03}
crawling with vein-like ivy{03}
over every surface.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022a8}
Is that the light of an{03}
Elder Sign shining from{03}
beneath the ivy{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{000022ab}
The ivy comes alive and{03}
attacks me{75}{02}{00}
------------------
{000022ae}
The Elder Sign casts an{03}
eerie glow.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022b1}
Shall I attempt to unseal{03}
it{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{000022b4}
I'll ignore the Elder Sign{03}
for now.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022b7}
I unsealed the Elder Sign.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022ba}

this room.{02}{00}

{000022c3}
{79}Offer the Holy Words{7a} is{03}
engraved on the altar.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022c6}
I see a statue here.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022c9}
Some sort of dark force{03}
holds it in place.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022cc}
The passageway becomes a{03}
gentle slope.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022cf}
I see the spirits of{03}
Benedict's parents appear{03}
from the darkness...{02}{00}
------------------
{000022d2}
We have our freedom, and{03}
are in your eternal debt.{02}Thank you so much. But the{03}
true cause of the anomalies{03}
remains still.{02}Cross between worlds to the{03}
hall in the other dimension{03}
and bring back our son.{02}Unless he returns, there{03}
will be disaster upon all{03}
the world.{02}We pray for your success.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022d5}
The spirit couple vanishes{03}
from my gaze.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022d8}
I try the bell but it does{03}
not appear to work.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022db}
The floor and the walls are{03}
all damp.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022de}
This statue seems to be a{03}
fountain. Its mouth is open{03}
but no water flows out.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022e1}
A small lever.{03}
Shall I try pulling it{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{000022e4}
Water now flows from the{03}
fountain.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022e7}
The water gathers in the{03}
dried out pool below. I{03}
retrace my steps in panic.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022ea}
A memo was left behind.{03}
{79}One should not enter the{03}
chapel without a bible.{7a}{02}{00}

------------------
{000022f6}
I feel a presence enter the{03}
room...{02}{00}
------------------
{000022f9}
A twisted presence lies in{03}
the room on the northern{03}
side.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022fc}
Perhaps Salts of Amun may{03}
purify him, but those{03}
without should flee.{02}{00}
------------------
{000022ff}
Fighting him is a gesture{03}
in futility.{02}Please, just run away{03}
while you still can.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002302}
This room is strangely{03}
colder than the others.{02}I see something in the far{03}
left of the room.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002305}
The corpse's face is frozen{03}
in terror.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002308}
A folded map is in his{03}
pocket.{02}{00}
------------------

This is the corpse of the{03}
person sent by the town who{03}
is said to have vanished.{02}Should I just carry it back{03}
to town{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{00002311}
This corpse is ancient.{03}
But its hollow eye sockets{03}
still seem like that watch.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002314}
A small, crying child{03}
entered via a secret{03}
passageway in the very{02}{00}
------------------
{00002317}
same room in which Master{03}
Benedict disappeared.{03}

on the ground.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002335}
The shelves lining this{03}
musty room are completely{02}covered in spider webs.{03}
What manner of tomes and{03}
antiquities are here{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{00002338}
I see some sort of blade{03}
laying upon the shelf.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000233b}
Curved Backsword acquired.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000233e}
The bell of this hall has{03}
powers of purification.{02}However, the Elder Sign has{03}
sealed shut the door to{03}
reach the bell.{02}Please, ring the bell and{03}
free us from our torment.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002341}
I am the butler for the{03}
Weathertops.{02}Woe has befallen our hall{03}
since Master Benedict{03}
dabbled in maths most dark.{02}We are bound to this{03}
hall as lost souls.{03}
Please save us.{02}Here is the key to Master{03}
Benedict's private chamber.{03}
Please search it well.{02}Also, the spirit of Master{03}
Benedict's father...{02}... resides in a painting{03}
in the drawing room.{02}He knows far more about the{03}
curse in the hall than I,{03}
so please speak to him.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002344}
The door is locked.{02}It appears far too heavy{03}
for me to try and open it{03}
by force.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002347}
The other side seems to be{03}
blocked with a bar.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000234a}
Not much to see here, it{03}
seems.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000234d}
Broken Camera acquired.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002350}
Its appearance seems weird{03}
somehow, but I don't think{03}
it will attack me.{02}{00}

of it.{02}{00}

This book seems to{03}
consume light.{02}{00}

{00002380}
Learned {79}Blind{7a} invocation.{02}{00}

{00002383}
A stone humming with power{03}
is in the drawer.{02}{00}

------------------
{00002389}
I hear a sound. Something{03}
approaches{75}{02}{00}
------------------
{0000238c}
Shall I remove the trap{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{0000238f}
I undo the trap.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002392}
A face appears on the front{03}
of the door and attacks{75}{02}{00}
------------------
{00002395}
I am pinned down by a{03}
mysterious force.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002398}
None of it makes sense,{03}
but there is a mark on the{03}
section of Laplace's Demon{02}{00}
------------------
{0000239b}
A rat scurries in.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000239e}
The bookshelf fell down{75}{02}{00}
------------------
{000023a1}
A desk suddenly lifts{03}
itself into the air and{03}
charges at me{75}{02}{00}
------------------
{000023a4}
An eerie laugh echoes{03}
throughout the room, then{03}
just as suddenly stops.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023a7}
A black shadow emanates{03}
from the book's pages.{02}{79}You will find only death{03}
in this hall. Beware the{03}
mansion's curse{75}{7a}{02}The shadow disappeared,{03}
leaving behind an eerie{03}
laugh.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023aa}
The stacked books collapse{02}{00}
------------------
{000023ad}
A vision manifested itself{03}
before me.{02}A shadowy man clasping a{03}
bloodied dagger muttering.{02}He appears to be praying to{03}
an Elder Sign.{02}His invocation begins, and{03}
then ends with a demand for{03}
his mother's resurrection.{02}Before anything else could{03}
happen, the vision faded.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023b0}
I'm having strange episodes{03}
where I lose consciousness.{02}While out, even if only for{03}
a moment, I experience odd{03}
visions of a fantasy world.{02}In it there's a castle from{03}
the Middle Ages, right in{03}
the middle of a forest.{02}I thought I saw the face of{03}
Benedict Weathertop in one{03}
of its windows. Odd.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023b3}
You intend to go to{03}
Weathertop Hall, right{76}{02}You should take my advice{03}
and just quit.{02}The last group of four{03}
went inside just recently,{03}
and never returned.{02}But if you're going to go{03}
there anyway, I have some{03}
tools for sale.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023b6}
Welcome, what do you need{03}
today{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{000023b9}
Welcome. Will you require a{03}
room for the evening{76}{00}
------------------
{000023bc}
Welcome back. Do you need{03}
anything{76}{00}
------------------
{000023bf}
What'll it be today{76}{00}
------------------
{000023c2}
Here you can receive expert{03}
training on every manner of{03}
talent.{02}Would you like to start{03}
talent training{76}{00}
------------------
{000023c5}
Good to see you return.{03}
Will you train in talents{76}{00}
------------------
{000023c8}
Do you need something{76}{00}
------------------
{000023cb}
The future can be revealed{03}
to me. Any future can be.{02}What you are embroiled in{03}
is way bigger than you.{02}Do you wish to know what{03}
Fate has in store for you{76}{00}
------------------
{000023ce}
Wise are you to come to me,{03}
for I can reveal all that{03}
your Fate holds in store{75}{00}
------------------
{000023d1}
I see a man beset by a{03}
terrible curse.{02}Go to the drawing room and{03}
listen to what he has to{03}
say.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023d4}
I see a polite butler.{03}
Meet him and get the key{03}
he holds.{02}You may continue your{03}
visit from there.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023d7}
A spirit suffering from the{03}
hall's curse is seeking{03}
help.{02}It is in the north wing of{03}
the first floor.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023da}
One of the stars you're{03}
searching for is on the{03}
2nd floor.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023dd}
One of the stars you're{03}
searching for is in the{03}
basement.{02}But to get to it, you must{03}
drain the water from the{03}
lake.{02}A statue in the basement{03}
might be a clue.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023e0}
One of the stars you're{03}
searching for is in the{03}
basement.{02}But it is protected by an{03}
invincible presence{75}{02}Take some Salts of Amun.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023e3}
One of the stars you're{03}
searching for is in the{03}
basement.{02}But to get to it, you must{03}
find a secret path beneath{03}
the chapel.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023e6}
I can hear the wailing of{03}
Benedict's mother. A clue is{03}
likely buried in her grave.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023e9}
I can hear his mother's{03}
wailing from the 2nd floor.{02}Climb the stairs to the{03}
west.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023ec}
Ring the holy bell. Doing{03}
so should open the path to{03}
a new world.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023ef}
Undo the 4 Elder Signs{03}
and ring the bell.{02}Doing so will open the path{03}
to a new world.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023f2}
Benedict is not in this{03}
world.{02}He passed through the last{03}
remaining Elder Sign in{03}
the hall...{02}... and disappeared into{03}
another world.{02}He is in danger. He must be{03}
brought back, or immense{03}
disaster could befall us.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023f5}
Benedict is being held{03}
somewhere.{02}The first thing you should{03}
do is investigate the{03}
basement.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023f8}
To breathe life into{03}
the fountain, you{02}should search every nook an{03}
cranny of the basement.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023fb}
Giving life to the{03}
fountain will top the{03}
water flow.{02}Upon doing so, a path to{03}
the south should appear.{02}{00}
------------------
{000023fe}
Search for the head{03}
servant. He should be{03}
somewhere in the basement.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002401}
There are many people{03}
being held in the{03}
underground dungeon.{02}Find the cell key and{03}
rescue them.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002404}
Please go meet the{03}
impolite corpse.{02}He is waiting for you in{03}
the castle's torture{03}
chamber.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002407}
An arcane force is{03}
blocking your path to the{03}
south of the waterway.{02}Before you fight it,{03}
meet the wizard being held{03}
in the basement.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000240a}
An arcane force is{03}
blocking your path to the{03}
south of the waterway.{02}You must face it in order{03}
to go forward.{02}The magician you freed{03}
should help you.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000240d}
The enemy you must defeat{03}
is south of the waterway.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002410}
The object you seek is on{03}
the 2nd floor.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002413}
The place you are headed{03}
for is the north part of{03}
the 3rd floor.{02}Prepare for the worst. The{03}
path is long and difficult.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002416}
The place you are headed{03}
for is the west part of{03}
the 3rd floor.{02}Prepare for the worst. The{03}
path is long and difficult.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002419}
The place you are headed{03}
for is the west part of{03}
the 3rd floor.{02}A great sorrow awaits you{03}
there.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000241c}
The place you are headed to{03}
is the northwest part of{03}
the 3rd Floor.{02}Several mysteries await you{03}
there.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000241f}
The ferryman statue is on{03}
the 2nd floor{a8} the compass{03}
is on the 3rd.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002422}
A girl is being held to the{03}
northeast of the lake. You{03}
have to meet her.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002425}
I can see Benedict.{02}He is being held in a room{03}
in the southeast part of{03}
the 3rd floor.{02}An undead monster guards{03}
him that you cannot fight.{02}A holy goblet or talisman c{03}
can drive it away to get to{03}
Benedict.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002428}
I can see Benedict.{02}He is being held in a room{03}
in the southeast part of{03}
the third floor.{02}An undead monsters guards{03}
him there.{02}The curse on the monster{03}
can be undone with a holy{03}
cup or talisman.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000242b}
A beautiful princess waits{03}
for you by the lake.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000242e}
See the king. If you don't,{03}
this world shall soon be{03}
destroyed.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002431}
Benedict slipped through an{03}
Elder Sign again in order{03}
to usurp Laplace's throne.{02}Destruction is all that{03}
waits for him there.{02}And that destruction shall{03}
consume our world as well.{02}Once through the Elder Sign{03}
you may not be able to come{03}
back through it this way.{02}Seek those in the other{03}
world who may be willing to{03}
lend you aid.{02}Make all necessary{03}
preparations before you go{03}
to the other side.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002434}
You want to examine the{03}
haunted hall too, right{76}{02}A lot of folks doing the{03}
same have gathered here.{03}
You should talk to them.{02}Detectives rely on guns and{03}
wits. Mediums have access{03}
to powers of psychomancy.{02}Your journalist can capture{03}
photographs of the foes you{03}
meet and sell them.{02}That scientist has some odd{03}
machine that appears to be{03}
quite powerful.{02}The dabbler understands{03}
the magic of mythos, but{03}
also carries a firearm.{02}Take all this into your{03}
consideration as you are{03}
choosing who will go with{02}you into Weathertop Hall.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002437}
How's the investigation{03}
going{76}{02}By the way, did you see the{03}
old fortune teller{76}{02}She has a reputation of{03}
being eerily accurate.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000243a}
You're going to Weathertop{03}
Hall{76}{02}They say there are monsters{03}
there, so you'd best bring{03}
Medicine and Charms.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000243d}
I wonder if that missing{03}
girl Amy is all right{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{00002440}
{01}{02}Alec Quinn. Detective.{02}I'm investigating the local{03}
girl who went missing near{03}
Weathertop Hall.{02}I don't think any of us{03}
should go in there alone.{02}So, how about the both of{03}
us go in together{76} It'd be{03}
safest with the two of us{02}watching each others'{03}
backs.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{00002443}
{01}{02}Outstanding{75} The girl I'm{03}
searching for is named Amy.{02}Her mother is sitting just{03}
over by the bar, if you'd{03}
like to speak with her.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{00002446}
{01}{02}Rats{75} If you feel like you{03}
want to change your tune, I{03}
will be around.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{00002449}
{01}{02}Alec Quinn. Detective.{02}I'm investigating the local{03}
girl who went missing near{03}
Weathertop Hall.{02}If you feel like you need{03}
my help, I'll be around if{03}
you come looking for me.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{0000244c}
{01}{09}My name is Morgan Dylan.{03}
I'm a journalist.{02}I came to get a scoop on{03}
the Weathertop Hall case.{02}You're going to the haunted{03}
mansion, right{76}{02}Word on the street is the{03}
hall is haunted and full of{03}
horrible creatures.{02}Mind if I tag along{76}{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{0000244f}
{01}{09}Thanks.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{00002452}
{01}{09}That's a damn shame.{02}I'll be at the hotel, so if{03}
you change your mind, come{03}
find me, okay{76}{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{00002455}
{01}{09}The name's Morgan Dylan.{03}

the Weathertop Hall case.{02}Word on the street is the{03}

hotel, so come by if you{03}
need me for anything.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{00002458}
{01}{05}Hello I'm Vincent Hoffman.{03}
Weathertop Hall seems a{03}
perfect place to test my{02}Spirit Machine, but I'm{03}
too scared to go alone.{03}
Please take me with you.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{0000245b}
{01}{05}You have my gratitude.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{0000245e}
{01}{05}I see. I'll be at the hotel{03}
if you change your mind, so{03}
please come by.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{00002461}
{01}{05}I'm Vincent Hoffman.{03}
I'm here to test my newly{03}
developed Spirit Machine.{02}If you'd like to know the{03}
true power of my machine,{03}
please come to the hotel.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{00002464}
{01}{0a}I'm Lamonte Blackwood.{03}
I dabble in things like{03}
the mythos and magic.{02}I came to see if this{03}
Weathertop event was truly{03}
one involving the mythos,{02}but I can't continue{03}
investigating by myself.{02}It looks like you're going{03}
to Weathertop Hall, so{03}
won't you let me come too{76}{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{00002467}
{01}{0a}Thank you.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{0000246a}
{01}{0a}Oh, such a dreadful shame.{02}I've made my sanctum at the{03}
hotel, so seek me there if{03}
you change your mind.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{0000246d}
{01}{0a}I'm Lamonte Blackwood.{03}
I dabble in things like{03}
the mythos and magic.{02}My sanctum is at the hotel.{03}
If you seek my knowledge,{03}
come see me there.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{00002470}
{01}{06}My name is Dirk August.{02}I have spiritual powers...{02}and I came here to use them{03}
to exorcise the evil spirit{03}
hiding in Weathertop Hall.{02}How about it{76} Shall we go{03}
together{76}{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{00002473}
{01}{06}Well then, let's go.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{00002476}
{01}{06}That's too bad. I'll be at{03}
the hotel, so if you need{03}
my help please come by.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{00002479}
{01}{06}My name is Dirk August.{02}I have spiritual powers...{02}and I came here to use them{03}
to exorcise the evil spirit{03}
hiding in Weathertop Hall.{02}I'll be at the hotel, so if{03}
you need my help please{03}
come by.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{0000247c}
You can have a maximum of{03}
five characters altogether,{02}but only four people active{03}
in your party for now.{02}You will likely find your{03}
fifth member during your{03}
investigation.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000247f}
If you don't have a medium,{03}
it is impossible to fight{03}
back against spirits.{02}Bullets and knives pass{03}
right through their{03}
incorporeal forms.{02}If you use the psychomancy{03}
Temper on your weaponry,{02}though, your weapons can{03}
then harm them.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002482}
Benedict Weathertop is a{03}
master of magic and math.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002485}
Weathertop Hall is cursed.{02}Many have gone in, but not{03}
a single one has ever{03}
come back out.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002488}
Ever since his mother died,{03}
Benedict has mourned.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000248b}
An oriental man entered{03}
Weathertop Hall.{02}But I haven't seen him come{03}
back out...{02}{00}
------------------
{0000248e}
Some time ago, a purple{03}
aurora appeared above{03}
Weathertop Hall, and{02}Benedict vanished from{03}
sight.{02}Ever since that day, the{03}
hall has been cursed.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002491}
You should buy lots of{03}
batteries and bullets so{03}
you don't run out of them.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002494}
You should not only buy a{03}
camera ahead of time, but{03}
film as well.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002497}
You should buy knives and{03}
other weapons for times{03}
when you run out of ammo.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000249a}
Always in motion, is the{03}
future. I can show you your{03}
destiny, but it is up to{02}you to grasp it. I am only{03}
a guide{a8} you must make my{03}
fortune come true.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000249d}
One session of divination{03}
for {eb}10. Is that okay{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{000024a0}
Don't try to cheat me. The{03}
spirits hate that.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024a3}
Come back when you next{03}
seek guidance.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024a6}
Spirits guide you.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024a9}
It's {eb}10 per person, so it{03}
will be {eb}{04}{03}
 total. Will{03}
that be okay{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{000024ac}
This ain't no charity, bub.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024af}
Rest well, and do mind the{03}
bedbugs, please.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024b2}
Good morning.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024b5}
I will record your progress{03}
in the investigation. Okay{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{000024b8}
Done. What else can I do{03}
for you{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{000024bb}
Everyone is in the salon.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024be}
Is there anything else you{03}
need{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{000024c1}
I see no one at present.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024c4}
Please take care.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024c7}
Is there anything else you{03}
need{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{000024ca}
When your soul has grown in{03}
magnitude, come back again{03}
to train.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024cd}
Nothing to examine now.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024d0}
Here are the pictures of{03}
monsters you have taken{03}
thus far.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024d3}
Maybe we should take some{03}
actual photographs first,{03}
huh.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024d6}
If you're going to{03}
Weathertop Hall, I have a{03}
request to make of you.{02}I'm sure you have heard{03}
of the case of the two{03}
murdered children.{02}My daughter went with them{03}
to the hall as well, and I{03}
fear that a most dreadful{02}fate has befallen her. I am{03}
beside myself with worry.{02}Please, find my daughter{03}
Amy. I will pay you {eb}1000{03}
if you do. It's all I have.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024d9}
Should I accept{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{000024dc}
Have you found my daughter{03}
Amy{76} Even if she's dead, I{03}
must bury her properly.{02}Please, you must find my{03}
Amy for me.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024df}
Thank you.{02}I'll be here as often as I{03}
can so please share with me{03}
anything you find.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024e2}
We brought Amy back{a8} her{03}
mother was waiting for us.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024e5}
{79}Amy, I never thought I{03}
would see you safe again.{03}
Thank you all so much.{02}It's not much, but please{03}
take this.{7a}{02}{00}

{000024ee}
Received {eb}600 as a reward.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024f1}
Realized 2500 experience.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024f4}
Is it true that you went{03}
into that haunted hall{76}{02}Well then, my husband says{03}
there's something he'd like{03}
to ask you.{02}Please talk to him when you{03}
have a moment. It will be{03}
worth your time.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024f7}
You entered the hall and{03}
still returned{76} Amazing{75}{02}Did you see anyone else in{03}
there, by any chance{76} So{03}
many have gone missing.{02}The last was a group of{03}
four who went in a little{03}
before you did.{02}It may not be possible, but{03}
even the corpses would help{03}
bring closure.{02}If you find them, could you{03}
bring them home{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{000024fa}
They said the wanted to{03}
explore the basement.{03}
That's where I'd look.{02}{00}
------------------
{000024fd}
I see. Well then, I'll keep{03}
asking around.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002500}
I'll be at the hotel, so{03}
if you change your mind,{03}
come see me.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002503}
I'll be at the hotel, so if{03}
there's something you need,{03}
do drop in.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002506}
I'll be at the hotel. If{03}
you change your mind, come{03}
see me.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002509}
I'll be at the hotel, so if{03}
you need me for something,{03}
stop by.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000250c}
I'll be at the hotel, so if{03}
you need my help, please{03}
come by.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000250f}
I've left the corpse{03}
with the grave keeper.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002512}
I hear you found some of{03}
the missing people, or{03}
their bodies at least...{02}I suppose at least it has{03}
brought closure to their{03}
families.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002515}
Everyone is grateful for{03}
your efforts. It's not{03}
much, but please have this.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002518}
{eb}300 received.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000251b}
500 Exp. Points gained.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000251e}
Hey, you're Gordon, right{76}{03}
You look rather unwell. Is{03}
everything all right{76}{02}I think you need a trip to{03}
the hospital, pal.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002521}
The clerk and customers{03}
worked together and took{03}
Gordon to the hospital.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002524}
Realized 500 experience.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002527}
Thank you for bringing me{03}
back. Are the others okay{76}{02}Perhaps you should visit{03}
the hospital. You could{03}
learn something.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000252a}
It's not much of a reward,{03}
but I'll give you this.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000252d}
Witchcraft Athame{03}
acquired.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002530}
Take care.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002533}
You're the ones exploring{03}
the haunted hall and are{03}
somehow still alive, right{76}{02}I'm looking for someone{03}
who went in but never came{03}
out.{02}His name is Luis Martin.{03}
Will you look for him for{03}
me{76}{02}I don't have much money,{03}
but I can also offer this{03}
camera.{02}Can you help me{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{00002536}
Thank you.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002539}
I see. Well then, I'll keep{03}
asking around.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000253c}
Martin is dead{76} No...{03}
One last thing to do,{03}
then.{02}He needs a proper burial.{03}
Deserves that much.{02}Can you take his body{03}
to the cemetery{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{0000253f}
I appreciate your bringing{03}
Martin back.{02}Here are the items I{03}
promised you.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002542}
{eb}100 and Brownie Camera{03}
received.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002545}
Realized 500 experience.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002548}
Good to see you here.{03}
Is there something I can do{03}
for you{76}{02}All I've really got is{03}
information about the hall{03}
that I can share with you.{02}Should I listen to Gordon's{03}
information{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{0000254b}
Hey. Is the investigation{03}
progressing well{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{0000254e}
I've heard there are many{03}
hidden rooms in the hall's{03}
basement.{02}And those Elder Signs are{03}
just full of important{03}
secrets within the hall.{02}The last word on Benedict{03}
is he vanished somehow from{03}
within his study.{02}My money's on a hidden door{03}
somewhere in there.{02}Oh, and I've heard this{03}
oriental guy was snooping{03}
around there after.{02}He left a notebook there,{03}
and I've gotten a hold of{03}
it.{02}I sent it to the library{03}
for safekeeping.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002551}
I see. Well then, please{03}
take care.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002554}
You want to see the{03}
notebook Gordon left{76} Just{03}
a moment, please.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002557}
Here you are.{02}Notebook received.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000255a}
Hall 2F Map received.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000255d}
Return to Newcam{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{00002560}
A grand piano sits there.{02}Not one to just leave stuff{03}
that isn't mine alone, I{03}
make for the keys.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002563}
A painting of an old man{03}
hangs on the wall.{02}{79}Richard Weathertop{7a} is{03}
written on the frame.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002566}
I can't help but feel like{03}
this painting is watching{03}
me somehow...{02}{00}
------------------
{00002569}
Nothing strange to see{03}
here.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000256c}
There are dishes arranged{03}
neatly on the table.{02}As I try to examine a dish,{03}
the tableware levitates{03}
into the air and attacks{75}{02}{00}
------------------
{0000256f}
A door with a face on it{76}{03}
Oh, no.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002572}
{79}{04}{00},{7a} a voice in{03}
my head starts saying.{02}The voice made me feel odd.{03}
But I let it keep going.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002575}
The bell of this hall can{03}
purify evil. Please ring it{03}
and free us.{02}But the door to the bell is{03}
sealed by the power of the{03}
four Elder Signs.{02}An evil spirit seals the{03}
power of the bell itself.{02}Destroying the Elder Signs{03}
will open the door.{02}But only the lady of the{03}
house knows the method of{03}
restoring the bell.{02}Ring it and let its sound{03}
cleanse the curse on us{75}{02}{00}
------------------
{00002578}
A painting of a fussy man{03}
hangs on the wall.{02}The picture frame says{03}
Benedict Weathertop.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000257b}
I step into the Elder Sign,{03}
causing flames to erupt out{03}
of its center.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000257e}
The atmosphere around it{03}
has somehow just changed{a8}{03}
I don't feel uneasy now.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002581}
So there was this one time,{03}
I opened up a closet door,{03}
and a skeleton attacked me.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002584}
The Weathertop history is{03}
written in this.{02}They moved here from Salem{03}
following its infamous{03}
witch hunts in the 1600s.{02}The family carries with it{03}
a tradition of research{03}
into the mythos.{02}The fact that Benedict{03}
caused this event must be{03}
because it's in his blood.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002587}
It's written in small, tense{03}
characters, apparently{03}
Benedict's handwriting.{02}The ceremony brought forth{03}
an unimaginable effect.{02}It didn't do anything for{03}
my mother's revival...{02}... but a glorious new{03}
world opened up before my{03}
very eyes.{02}I'm going to the mysterious{03}
castle which is brimming{03}
with magic.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000258a}
{04}{00} used the Iron{03}
Key.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000258d}
{04}{00} used the Copper{03}
Key.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002590}
{04}{00} used the Silver{03}
Key.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002593}
A soft light emanates from{03}
the memento ring, and the{03}
door opens.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002596}
The spirit was annihilated.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002599}
{01}{08}{04}{00}, are you okay{76}{02}Somehow I made my way back{03}
here.{02}My partner has gone missing{03}
and I must find him.{02}He's in the castle for{03}
some reason or another.{02}I want to look for him,{03}
but I can't go by{03}
myself.{02}When you go there, can{03}
I go with you{76}{02}I'll be at the hotel.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{0000259c}
Looks like a fairytale{03}
wizard in a black robe...{02}... was standing near{03}
Weathertop Hall.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000259f}
A man in black clothes{03}
was prowling around{03}
the hospital.{02}I told him to stop, and he{03}
suddenly vanished.{02}{00}
------------------
{000025a2}
I hear a purple aurora has{03}
appeared above Weathertop{03}
Hall.{02}Hey now...{02}I heard the same thing{03}
happened before when{03}
Weathertop vanished.{02}{00}
------------------
{000025a5}
The kids claim they saw{03}
a gargoyle.{02}I heard that it flew back{03}
towards the hall after{03}
circling the town.{02}{00}
------------------
{000025a8}
Do your best, okay{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{000025ab}
{04}{00}{75} I hear Benedict{03}
escaped.{02}A wizard or something{03}
attacked the police when{03}
they tried to get him back.{02}Yeah, he looked like a{03}
wizard all right.{02}And this fairy tale guy in{03}
black carries him off.{02}{00}
------------------
{000025ae}
{01}{03}
Thanks. I'll rest here{03}
for a time.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025b1}
Kenichiro is in bed.{03}
He looks better.{02}{01}{03}
How proceeds your{03}
investigation{76}{02}I've heard word of a lake{03}
monster who dwells on the{03}
southeastern lake floor.{02}You must find a way past{03}
that awful beast{75}{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025b4}
{01}{03}
Laplace's maths and mythos{03}
are powerful indeed.{02}It's been said that the{03}
demon Laplace summoned can{03}
read all possible futures,{02}but that power only works{03}
in the confines of the{03}
world it was summoned to.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025b7}
{01}{03}
Laplace Castle gets more{03}
surreal the further you go.{02}Somewhere on the top floor{03}
lies a dark tear in the{03}
fabric of space.{02}That tear is a gateway{03}
between dimensions.{02}If you fell in, you'd most{03}
probably die... or worse.{02}But what lies beyond is{03}
merely an illusion created{03}
by Laplace's Demon.{02}Without Laplace or his{03}
demon, it would likely{03}
vanish to the void.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025ba}
{01}{03}
I fear Benedict may be{03}
trying to summon Laplace's{03}
demon into our world...{02}Here in this very town.{02}Benedict would have in his{03}
hands a means to decide the{03}
very fate of America...{02}No, of the entire world.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025bd}
{01}{03}
I can't just stand here and{03}
do nothing.{02}Even if we stop Benedict,{03}
the demon is still inside{03}
Laplace Castle.{02}Let us hope the Elder Sign{03}
connecting that castle and{03}
the hall stays unfinished.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025c0}
{01}{03}
I'm exhausted.{03}
May I rest a bit{76}{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025c3}
{01}{00}Oh, is this{03}
yours{76}{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025c6}
{01}{01}Oh, does this belong{03}
to you, Kenichiro{76}{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025c9}
I handed the notebook{03}
to Kenichiro.{02}{01}{03}
My notebook{75}{03}
Arigato. And for your{03}
troubles, have this card.{02}The magic within this ofuda{03}
is one of protection.{02}Ofuda of Protection{03}
acquired.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025cc}
{01}{03}
{04}{00}, I as well wish{03}
to explore Laplace Castle{03}
shortly.{02}If you desire my aid,{03}
you can find me at the{03}
hotel.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025cf}
The receptionist glanced{03}
questioningly at the{03}
figure of Benedict.{02}{01}{0e}I will stay here and rest,{03}
but you take this.{02}It's a key that will allow{03}
access to Laplace himself.{02}He took out a beautiful{03}
emerald statue.{02}It won't help me anymore.{02}Emerald Effigy acquired.{02}Come and see me if you need{03}
the benefit of my expertise{03}
in these matters.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025d2}
{01}{0e}I said I'd tell you about{03}
Laplace Castle.{02}The place has five levels{03}
of environments.{02}Laplace keeps his throne on{03}
the fourth floor.{02}His demon doesn't dwell in{03}
the same space as us.{02}Laplace made sure that only{03}
he could contact it.{02}I am not quite certain how{03}
to enter that space myself.{02}Laplace has a daughter that{03}
hates him named Cassandra.{02}She foolishly tried to use{03}
psychomancy to exorcise the{03}
Demon from our world.{02}She failed, of course, and{03}
went into a prison cell.{02}Why had I been captured{76}{02}I almost killed Laplace.{02}I know that the Demon can{03}
reverse the flow of time.{02}I traveled here by Elder{03}
Sign in order to bring my{03}
mother back to life.{02}Then I met Louvain.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025d5}
{01}{00}Louvain{76} Who's that{76}{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025d8}
{01}{01}Louvain{76} Who's that{76}{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025db}
{01}{0e}A wizard. He taught me{03}
many things.{02}He helped me come up with{03}
the plan to steal the{03}
Demon...{02}It seems Louvain{03}
despises Laplace.{02}He said he couldn't let{03}
a fool hold great power.{02}Just a little later,{03}
Kenichiro got in our{03}
way.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025de}
{01}{00}But then Louvain{03}
deceived you{76}{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025e1}
{01}{01}But then Louvain deceived{03}
you, didn't he{76}{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025e4}
{01}{0e}I don't know quite what{03}
he's up to...{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025e7}
{01}{0e}The demon uses strong{03}
magic, but it can't be{03}
perfect.{02}Even Laplace started{03}
doubting the demon.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025ea}
{04}{00}, Benedict{03}
escaped{75}{02}They say he went to{03}
Weathertop Hall with a{03}
man in a black robe.{02}{00}
------------------
{000025ed}
Let's take Kenichiro to{03}
the hospital.{02}{00}
------------------
{000025f0}
As you enter the bar,{03}
everyone's attention{03}
turns toward Benedict.{02}{00}
------------------
{000025f3}
{01}{00}You are sure popular,{03}
Benedict.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025f6}
{01}{01}You're a pretty popular{03}
guy, aren't you, Benedict{76}{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025f9}
{01}{0e}Hmph{75} {04}{00}, hurry{03}
and take me to the{03}
hospital.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025fc}
{01}{0e}Are you going to{03}
Laplace Castle again{76}{02}I'm at my limit. Hurry up{03}
and take me to the{03}
hospital.{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{000025ff}
{01}{0e}Enough{75} I'm returning{03}
to town by myself.{02}Here's a reward for{03}
helping me.{02}Benedict took out a{03}
beautiful emerald statue.{02}You'll need this to{03}
enter Laplace's room.{02}I don't need it anymore,{03}
so you take it.{02}Emerald Effigy acquired.{02}If you want anything,{03}
come to my hospital room.{02}{01} {03}
Benedict walked down the{03}
road leading to Newcam.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002602}
Police officers are all{03}
over town.{02}What's going on{76}{02}{00}
------------------
{00002605}
{01}{02}{04}{00}, it's damn good{03}
to see you{75} That rat{03}
Benedict escaped.{02}He had help from that scary{03}
wizard guy who came out of{03}
Laplace's Domain.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002608}
You say Benedict went{03}
back to the house{76}{02}He was with a magician that{03}
injured some police{03}
officers.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000260b}
Mister Kusakabe told me to{03}
order in some things to be{03}
used specially.{02}I have for you a Thompson{03}
Model 1921 submachine gun,{02}and a Remington Model 10{03}
12-gauge shotgun. You go{03}
and do what you have to.{02}{00}
------------------
{0000260e}
Fighting that kind of evil{03}
has got to be really tough.{03}
Maybe even the toughest.{02}I'd hate to meet the evil{03}
that can stand up to these.{02}Acquired a submachine gun{03}
and a shotgun and shells.{02}{00}
------------------
{00002611}
{01}{00}I remember{75}{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{00002614}
{01}{05}I remember{75}{02}{01} {00}
------------------
{00002617}
{01}{01}I remember{75}{02}{01} {00}
------------------
