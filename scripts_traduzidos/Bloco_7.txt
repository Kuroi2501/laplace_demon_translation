{000026f2}
A servant is standing up.{03}
He seems to be ignoring{03}
his duties.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000026f5}
Here comes a headache.{02}
This would appear to be the{03}
Maze of Mirrors.{02}
We have to pass through one{03}
particular mirror to get{03}
out of this.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000026f8}
An Elder Sign.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000026fb}
An old sea chest.{02}
Inside is an ornate wooden{03}
ship's figurehead carved in{03}
the shape of a dragon.{02}
Ship's Figurehead acquired.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000026fe}
I was suddenly ambushed{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002701}
This maid is staring at me,{03}
or rather what I'm wearing.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002704}
The woman ran off with a{03}
frightened look.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002707}
There used to be a nice man{03}
around here who would pilot{03}
the ferry over on the lake.{02}
He tried to help Cassandra{03}
escape across the lake and{03}
run away from her father.{02}
So I can only imagine that{03}
he was killed as a result.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000270a}
When the conversation ended{03}
a guard appeared.{02}
You{75} Come peacefully{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000270d}
In the drawer was a weird{03}
little patchwork doll on a{03}
safety pin.{02}
Mermaid Charm acquired.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002710}
A sprung trap. Timely.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002713}
A shy{7d}looking servant.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002716}
He ran off.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002719}
I've sealed up the door to{03}
the stairs south of here.{02}
A monster laired there has{03}
taken to eating humans that{03}
pass by it.{02}
But I can unlock the door{03}
if you truly insist.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000271c}
Be careful.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000271f}
You want any of the monster{03}
that lives up yonder, cause{03}
I don't want none of that.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002722}
A bearded hunter.{03}
He seems friendly{03}
enough.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002725}
The rocky mountain path{03}
to the north is where a{03}
gryphon keeps its lair.{02}
I would avoid that place.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002728}
{01}{0f}Where there's a monster,{03}
there's treasure.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000272b}
The door is locked.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000272e}
An ominous forest stands{03}
in my way.{02}
This castle strangely seems{03}
like it's somehow bigger on{03}
the inside.{02}
A small path cuts through{03}
the forest.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002731}
A monster with head and{03}
wings of an eagle and a{03}
body of a lion appeared.{02}
The monster looked at me{03}
and it bowed its forefoot{03}
and screeched.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002734}
{01}{0f}That's the bastard who's in{03}
the way of our treasure{75}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002737}
The beast had been guarding{03}
a real deal treasure chest.{02}
Inside of it was a grail,{03}
a trident, gloves, and a{03}
a magic book.{02}
Oh, and several jewels{75}{02}
The book's mythos makes you{03}
start coughing.{02}
Learned {79}Poison Spray{7a}{03}
invocation.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000273a}
{01}{0f}I'm taking the gems. You can{03}
have the rest.{02}
Take it easy, and stay dry{75}{02}
{01} Germaine quickly left.{02}
Orthodox Chalice, Combat{03}
Trident, and Phantasm{03}
Gloves acquired.{02}
Realized 3000 experience.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000273d}
Orthodox Chalice, Combat{03}
Trident, Phantasm Gloves,{03}
and Bag of Jewels acquired.{02}
Realized 1500 experience.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002740}
A corpse.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002743}
There's something familiar{03}
about this one...{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002746}
I'm starting to feel a{03}
spiritual presence...{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002749}
Manifesting before me, the{03}
phantom oarman wailed.{02}
Oarman for the lake, I was,{03}
for a great many years.{02}
But then the Lady Cassandra{03}
came and bid me ferry her{03}
to the other side.{02}
The King reacted by putting{03}
me here to die.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000274c}
Then I will stand here and{03}
remind you of my noble end.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000274f}
I can tell you all you want{03}
about my special boat.{02}
If you have the figurehead{03}
and a compass, you can guide{03}
the ship as you see fit.{02}
Though it can't go exactly{03}
anywhere you want it to,{03}
but you'll discover that.{02}
By the way, one of the two{03}
things you'll need is in my{03}
stash back in my quarters.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002752}
It seems you have a compass{03}
and figurehead.{02}
When you use my boat to{03}
escape this place, take my{03}
poor bones with you.{02}
Bury them, if you will, in{03}
the small cemetery on the{03}
west shore of the lake.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002755}
Thank you.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002758}
That's so unfortunate.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000275b}
{01}{00}
------------------
{0000275e}
{01}{01}Ew{75} I don't want to, but...{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002761}
A servant stands here.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002764}
Use your thoughts to guide{03}
the boat in the direction{03}
you want it to go in.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002767}
A pleasant{7d}looking woman,{03}
with a careworn expression,{03}
stares skyward.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000276a}
She stares at me briefly,{03}
screams, and runs away.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000276d}
The lakewaters have become{03}
dark and murky...{02}
... every day I feel myself{03}
growing stranger.{02}
Can I ever reclaim those{03}
carefree eras of my youth,{03}
or are they gone forever{76}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002770}
The only person in this{03}
castle with a mind totally{03}
their own is Cassandra.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002773}
Suddenly, there was the{03}
sound of a woman laughing.{02}
We are but a dream of the{03}
great Demon.{02}
When it wakes, will we all{03}
just disappear{76}{02}
Maybe we're its nightmares,{03}
and our very existence is{03}
its torment{76}{02}
There is only one way for{03}
this to be found out...{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002776}
There's a Dapper{7d}Dan Man.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002779}
He just ran off like he was{03}
in a real tight spot.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000277c}
Master Laplace won't greet{03}
anyone until the Emerald{03}
Effigy has been returned.{02}
I heard it's lost now even{03}
to the hands of the very{03}
thief who stole it.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000277f}
Some medical supplies.{02}
Remedy acquired.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002782}
Shit. I dropped it, and it{03}
broke into pieces.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002785}
This room is just icy cold.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002788}
The room is warm and humid.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000278b}
There seems to be something{03}
inside the statue.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000278e}
At the bottom of the pool{03}
lies an ancient Roman sword{03}
totally unaffected by rust.{02}
Sanctum Gladius acquired.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002791}
There is disturbed{7d}sounding{03}
laughter coming from the{03}
other side of the door.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002794}
There is a hunter wearing{03}
leather armor. He seems{03}
to be injured.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002797}
Some beast got the drop on{03}
me and I don't have any way{03}
of treating the injury.{02}
Can you help{76}{00}
------------------
{0000279a}
I'm sorry, but I don't have{03}
any medicine.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000279d}
I watched him use the{03}
medicine.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027a0}
I'll give you this, though{03}
as more than simply an{03}
expression of my gratitude.{02}
Somebody said this was some{03}
kind of alchemical reagent.{03}
Perhaps you can use it.{02}
Alchemical Alkahest{03}
acquired.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027a3}
I don't think I'm going to{03}
make it in this condition.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027a6}
There's a madman here.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027a9}
Hee, haa, hee, hee{75}{03}
Twist it all into the eye,{03}
its gaze is all the sky,{02}
a thing that never dies,{03}
a life that lives all lies,{03}
no deity decides,{02}
who goes to his Other side,{03}
the world of starlight,{02}
Of my lady I must divine,{03}
in the world out of time.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027ac}
I wish to go and meet the{03}
gods.{02}
Their servants must come{03}
together with the five{03}
pillars...{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027af}
In the drawer there was a{03}
small glass ampoule.{02}
Antivenin Ampoule{03}
acquired.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027b2}
A robed old man. He starts{03}
grumbling about something.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027b5}
What do you intend to do{76}{03}
Do you intend to anger me{76}{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027b8}
What're ya people doin'{03}
here{76}{02}
Such outlandish outfits,{03}
young'uns these days...{02}
Ya whippersnappers know{03}
about the Maze of Mirrors{03}

I reckon the're rare magical{03}
nostrum called Liquid Light{03}
in them maze.{02}
I'll give ya somethin' good{03}
if ya fetch me some.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027bb}
I always examine dead ends,{03}
because you never know who{03}
might have died in one.{02}
Here's a map so you'll be{03}
able to cheat your way out.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027be}
He sure is an odd one.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027c1}
What a cocky old kook.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027c4}
Castle 2F Map acquired.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027c7}
Oho{75} That's the Liquid Light{75}{02}
Gimme that and I'll give{03}
an item that can help you{03}
cross a chasm. {02}
{00}
------------------
{000027ca}
Mmmm. Thanky. Here's this{03}
weird thing.{02}
Throw it over a place where{03}
ya might be needin' a{03}
bridge.{02}
Acquired the Hand of Glory.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027cd}
That stuff ain't gonna be{03}
of any use to ya anyway...{02}
Come back if ya change{03}

{00}
------------------
{000027d0}
Go on, git{75} I'm busy, see{76}{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027d3}
There doesn't appear to be{03}
anything good waiting for{03}
us down in the fissure.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027d6}
I threw the dessicated hand{03}
and a macabre span of{03}
ossuary articles formed.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027d9}
It's a bridge made out of{03}
bones.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027dc}
A diary is laying here.{02}
Crimson Diary acquired.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027df}
It's Benedict's writing{75}{02}
It seems he was taken in by{03}
a wizard named Moldiv,{02}
and lived in the castle{03}
learning various mythos{03}
secrets.{02}
Then, one day he heard from{03}
a strange man named Louvain.{02}
... about the Demon that a{03}
mathematician named Laplace{03}
had bound to do his will.{02}
Knowing that this Demon had{03}
incredible powers, he made{03}
a plot to usurp control.{02}
But then Kenichiro came and{03}
the two fought against each{03}
other instead of Laplace.{02}
Benedict was on the run{03}
after this, and in hiding.{03}
That's the end of the book.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027e2}
There's that feeling again.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027e5}
On the wall is a fissure{03}
through which I see nothing{03}
but light.{02}
Minuscule shining droplets{03}
fall from the very bottom{03}
of the crack.{02}
Liquid Light acquired.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027e8}
I've always wanted to try{03}
riding off the edge of a{03}
waterfall...{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027eb}
I wake up next to an Elder{03}
Sign.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027ee}
I wake up in the Hall of{03}
Mirrors. Fantastic.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027f1}
The rapids becomes faster{03}
and more serious.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027f4}
This choppy water is too{03}
intense for our boat, and{03}
I fear we may capsize.{02}
I should turn around.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027f7}
Water flows south to where{03}
I can hear the roaring{03}
sound of more water.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027fa}
There's a new grave.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000027fd}
There's a hole.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002800}
It doesn't look like anyone{03}
else is using it.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002803}
I toss the corpse in.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002806}
Now I can sleep in peace.{03}
Thank you.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002809}
Realized 3000 experience.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000280c}
There's a monster with an{03}
ugly face.{02}
Who are you{76}{02}
Looking at your clothing,{03}
you must've passed through{03}
Weathertop Hall.{02}
Did you get caught in the{03}
foolish story about a{03}
haunted house{76}{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000280f}
Richard{75} Richard Pickman,{03}
it's me, Joanna Sullivan.{03}
Can't you tell{76}{02}
I've been searching for you{03}
all this time.{02}
Ever since that day you{03}
disappeared...{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002812}
... You again.{03}
Annoying woman{75}{02}
Even after I changed into{03}
this form, you hang around{03}
me stubbornly.{02}
I'm amazed you followed me{03}
this far.{02}
What is it you want{76} To{03}
kill me{76} Or perhaps be{03}
killed yourself{76}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002815}
Richard... Take me with{03}
you.{02}
No matter what form you{03}
take, I still love you and{03}
want to stay with you{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002818}
You liar. Your only real{03}
love is your infatuation{03}
with yourself.{02}
How many times did I suffer{03}
because of your ugly self{7d}{03}
indulgent love{75}{02}
You crushed my freedom{75}{03}
I've had enough from you{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000281b}
Richard...{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000281e}
I'm heading off to a{03}
different world.{02}
And I will start a new life{03}
without you.{02}
In an ideal world without{03}
mankind.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002821}
Wait, Richard{75} Don't{03}
go{75} Please, Richard{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002824}
{01}{05}Miss Sullivan, are you okay{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002827}
{01}{00}
------------------
{0000282a}
{01}{01}Joanna, are you alright{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000282d}
{01}{08}... I've been better...{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002830}
{01}{00}
------------------
{00002833}
{01}{01}Right. Who did this{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002836}
{01}{08}Richard Upton Pickman...{02}
He was a struggling artist,{03}
and my partner.{02}
Always aloof, one who can't{03}
love somebody else. He{03}
didn't love me either.{02}
But 3 years ago...{02}
He became absorbed in the{03}
mythos.{02}
The forbidden knowledge{03}
there likely made him a{03}
monster.{02}
Soon he disappeared.{02}
But part of me loves him{03}
still, so I search.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002839}
{01}{00}
------------------
{0000283c}
{01}{01}I see...{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000283f}
{01}{08}{04}{00}
------------------
{00002842}
Wearing a careworn smile,{03}
Joanna speeds off into{03}
the inky darkness.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002845}
Did you come to take back{03}
the woman I captured{76} Fine.{02}
I was thinking I'd eat her,{03}
but I'm fed up with her{03}
screaming.{02}
She's in the back room.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002848}
Get lost{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000284b}
The ghoul ran off howling.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000284e}
There is a woman. She seems{03}
terrified of me.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002851}
Please stop{75} Help me, Ryan{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002854}
Who's there{76} Are you human{76}{03}
Ah, I'm saved{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002857}
{01}{0c}Anita, you're safe{75}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000285a}
Ryan{76} You came to save me{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000285d}
{01}{0c}{04}{00}
------------------
{00002860}
Thanks, {04}{00}
------------------
{00002863}
Thanks for saving me.{03}
My name is Anita.{02}
Those monsters abducted me{03}
and were just about to have{03}
me killed{75}{02}
I heard that my brother{03}
Ryan was captured while{03}
trying to rescue me,{02}
and is being held in the{03}
underground dungeon.{02}
I'm going to go look for{03}
him.{02}
Bye{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002866}
Realized 1500 experience.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002869}
Thanks for saving me.{03}
My name is Anita.{02}
I was abducted by monsters,{03}
and they were just about to{03}
kill me.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000286c}
{01}{00}
------------------
{0000286f}
{01}{01}Anita, your brother Ryan{03}
is looking for you.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002872}
So he's here after all{75}{02}
I heard a rumor that he was{03}
captured while trying to{03}
rescue me.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002875}
I told Anita where Ryan{03}
is.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002878}
Thanks. I'm off to{03}
find him then.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000287b}
Oh, no{75} I ran into an{03}
ugly monster{75}{02}
{79}Humans{75} Kill{75} Devour{75}{7a}{00}
------------------
{0000287e}
It says{a2} South to the{03}
cemetery, West to the{03}
shrine.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002881}
A beautiful woman sits{03}
atop an extravagant bed.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002884}
{79}Who are you{76} I am{03}
Laplace's daughter,{03}
Cassandra.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002887}
{01}{07}You there{75} Just what are{03}
you doing{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000288a}
Won't you please get me{03}
out of here{76}{02}
I'm sorry, I have been{03}
trapped here for a long{03}
time, and I feel faint.{02}
I can't stand very well.{03}
Won't you lend me a hand{76}{7a}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000288d}
Still captivated by{03}
Cassandra's beauty,{03}
{04}{05} extended a hand.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002890}
{01}{03}
You're not Cassandra{75} Who{03}
are you{76}{75}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002893}
The not{7d}Cassandra grins{03}
evilly on a beautiful face.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002896}
{01}{07}But you're mine, now{75}{03}
Forget Cassandra,{03}
be mine forever{75}{02}
I will give you pleasures{03}
unknown for all eternity.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002899}
The moment I touch her{03}
hand an evil smile appears{03}
on her face.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000289c}
{01}{07}And now you're mine, pet.{03}
Forget Cassandra,{03}
be mine forever{75}{02}
I will give you pleasures{03}
unknown for all eternity.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000289f}
What a weird door{75} There's{03}
no keyhole, but it's locked{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{000028a2}
The door's decoration was{03}
the switch to undo the{03}
lock.{02}
When I press the switch, I{03}
hear the lock open with a{03}
click.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000028a5}
It's the same setup as the{03}
earlier room. A beautiful{03}
woman sits atop the bed.{02}
{01}{07}Who goes there{76} You mustn't{03}
be here. Run far away.{02}
If my father Laplace sees{03}
you here, I don't know what{03}
will happen...{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028a8}
{01}{0d}Princess, you're safe{75}{03}
It's Bayard.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028ab}
{01}{07}Ah, Bayard. Thank you{03}
for returning to me.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028ae}
{01}{0d}Princess, quickly now{75}{03}
Let's get you to safety.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000028b1}
{01}{03}
Princess Cassandra...{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028b4}
{01}{07}Kenichiro{76} I'm glad to see{03}
that you're safe.{02}
I hated my father when I{03}
was told you had died.{02}
Father is unwell, as you{03}
have said.{02}
He has realized that the{03}
Demon is beyond his power{03}
to fully control.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028b7}
{01}{03}
Just as I suspected...{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028ba}
{01}{07}Are you here to rescue me{76}{03}
I never thought anyone{03}
would even try...{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028bd}
{01}{07}I'm going to go east from{03}
here to the lake witch's{03}
place.{02}
If you are in the area,{03}
please come see me.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028c0}
{01}{0d}{04}{00}
------------------
{000028c3}
There's a guard.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000028c6}
Intruders{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{000028c9}
They say the witch who{03}
lives in the shack to the{03}
northeast sells stuff.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000028cc}
When I look from outside,{03}
I can't see any floors{03}
above this one.{02}
But when I climb the{03}
stairs... there it is. What{03}
is going on here{76}{02}
{00}
------------------
{000028cf}
Hey, it's that knight{03}
from earlier.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000028d2}
{01}{0d}If it isn't {04}{00}
------------------
{000028d5}
{01}{0d}I'm Bayard. Do you{03}
remember me, {04}{00}
------------------
{000028d8}
{01}{0d}I heard that Princess{03}
Cassandra was imprisoned{03}
on the lake isle,{02}
but I'm stuck here without{03}
some way to properly{03}
steer that boat.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028db}
{01}{0d}I'm going to look around{03}
a little while longer, and{03}
I could use your help.{02}
I will wait for you right{03}
here.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028de}
{01}{0d}Please allow me to assist{03}
you.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028e1}
{01}{0d}Thanks. We must find{03}
the Princess immediately.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028e4}
{01}{0d}That's too bad...{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028e7}
A man is crouched in the{03}
corner of the gloomy cell.{03}
It's Benedict Weathertop{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{000028ea}
{01}{03}
There you are, Benedict{75}{02}
Abandon your fool's errand{03}
and return to Newcam, or{03}
risk even further tragedy{75}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028ed}
{01}{0e}Kenichiro Kusakabe{75}{03}
You yet live{76}{02}
I saw Moldiv kill you,{03}
yet here you are...{02}
I thought I would rot here{03}
eternally in this cell, but{03}
now I am saved.{02}
I'll go peacefully, and{03}
tell you everything...{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028f0}
{01}{00}
------------------
{000028f3}
{01}{01}It can wait until we return{03}
to town.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028f6}
{01}{0e}How strange you folks are.{03}
Thanks anyways. Now kindly{03}
get me out of here{75}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028f9}
{01}{0d}{04}{00}
------------------
{000028fc}
{01}{0f}You're going back to{03}
Newcam now{76}{02}
Well then, I'll hunt for{03}
treasure solo, then.{03}
See you later{75}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000028ff}
{01}{04}Oh well. I'll go home by{03}
myself. Take care.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002902}
{01}{0c}I will be hiding in the{03}
western part of the court{7d}{03}
yard on the first floor.{02}
See you later.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002905}
{01}{08}I'll return myself after{03}
looking around a bit more.{02}
Let's meet at the bar in{03}
Newcam later.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002908}
Without any hesitance at{03}
all, Benedict joined the{03}
party.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000290b}
{01}{10}It seems you've found{03}
your friend. I guess I'll{03}
go see my friend too.{02}
We probably won't ever{03}
meet again.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000290e}
A skeleton in plate armor{03}
stands holding a sword.{02}
It observes me and points{03}
the sword in my direction{03}
in a challenge.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002911}
Though once scattered, the{03}
bones begin hopping around{03}
the ground to rejoin.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002914}
Clearly this isn't working.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002917}
{01}{00}
------------------
{0000291a}
{01}{01}What should we do...{76}{02}
It looks like it would be{03}
best to withdraw for now...{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000291d}
I hold the artifact above{03}
my head.{02}
A white light radiates off{03}
of it, and the knight{03}
staggers.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002920}
I hold up the crucifix.{02}
The sight of the cross{03}
makes the skeletal knight{03}
rattle and tremble.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002923}
It's a warm light.{03}
The curse placed upon{03}
me is broken.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002926}
The knight collapsed into a{03}
pile of armor, bone dust,{03}
and a talking skull.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002929}
Finally I am able to die,{03}
having fulfilled my mission{03}
beyond death.{02}
Only proof of my defeat can{03}
unlock the cell under my{03}
protection.{02}
Skull of Chivalry acquired.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000292c}
{01}{0b}{04}{00}
------------------
{0000292f}
{01}{03}
Are you not returning to{03}
Newcam...{76}{02}
I'm afraid I'm at my limit.{03}
I'll go back alone.{02}
{01} Kenichiro staggered off...{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002932}
There is a lizard monster.{02}
It seems to be wary,{03}
and is holding up its{03}
weapon.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002935}
I hear the skull knight{03}
who guards the lake's{03}
dungeon...{02}
... had a curse put on him{03}
so that he won't die.{02}
You'd best not take him{03}
on.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002938}
A bearded man who doesn't{03}
seem sociable has a store{03}
set up.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000293b}
If you want to deal with me{03}
you got to have more of the{03}
right stuff, if you follow.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000293e}
I deal in rare birds, so{03}
you had better be ready to{03}
hand over some cash.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002941}
I've run out of things to{03}
sell, so I guess I'll go{03}
somewhere else. See ya.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002944}
There was a magic book in{03}
the drawer.{02}
Learned {79}Emotion Control{7a}{03}
invocation.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002947}
Princess Cassandra is here.{03}
She gives me a sweet smile{03}
as she sees me.{02}
{00}
------------------
{0000294a}
{01}{07}I knew you'd come. I have{03}
a favor I must ask of you,{03}
if you'd but listen.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000294d}
{01}{00}
------------------
{00002950}
{01}{01}What is it{76} We're ready{03}
to help in any way{03}
possible.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002953}
{01}{07}Please, you must rescue my{03}
father. He may rule this{03}
world as Emperor,{02}
But that's only because he{03}
used Laplace's Demon to see{03}
into the future...{02}
... and created an attack{03}
plan that couldn't fail.{02}
But the status and honor he{03}
acquired is empty because{03}
it wasn't earned.{02}
My father knows this, but{03}
even so,{02}
he is using the demon still{03}
to secure the reign of his{03}
imperial throne.{02}
And so, the demon's power{03}
has warped this world.{02}
Without its power, this{03}
world will vanish.{02}
My father is to blame for{03}
all of this.{02}
But it is not too late.{02}
I want you to talk with my{03}
father...{02}
and have him break his{03}
infernal pact with{03}
the demon.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002956}
{01}{02}
Sorry, love. You expect too{03}
much from us regular folks.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002959}
{01}{05}How can we possibly sway or{03}
stop him{76} He has the power{03}
of a demon{75}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000295c}
{01}{06}Our power alone is not{03}
enough to make Emperor{03}
Laplace give in...{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000295f}
{01}{0a}Our strength alone will{03}
never be enough to convince{03}
Laplace of our cause.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002962}
{01}{00}
------------------
{00002965}
{01}{01}But he's a god here{75} How{03}
can we possibly win against{03}
a power like that{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002968}
{01}{07}But you are not from this{03}
world, you see.{02}
The demon's powers cannot{03}
predict or account for your{03}
actions.{02}
That is why he fears{03}
Kenichiro, Benedict, and{03}
all of you people.{02}
I believe defeating him{03}
will remove the demon's{03}
hold on him.{02}
And this problem is not{03}
limited to only this world.{02}
Benedict's gateway here has{03}
alerted my father to the{03}
existence of another world.{02}
A world just on the other{03}
side of the rift...{02}
That's right{a2} it's your{03}
world he wants now.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000296b}
{01}{02}
Are you serious{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000296e}
{01}{00}
------------------
{00002971}
{01}{01}Why our world{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002974}
{01}{06}What did you say{75}{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002977}
{01}{0a}Are you certain{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000297a}
{01}{03}
So you mean...{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000297d}
{01}{07}Perhaps he wishes for a{03}
world to conquer without{03}
need of the Demon...{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002980}
{01}{02}
Roger that{75} It's time for{03}
us to stop standing around{03}
and save the bloody world.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002983}
{01}{05}Gotcha. The numbers aren't{03}
in our favor, but it'll{03}
be zero if we don't try.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002986}
{01}{06}Damn. I've got a bad{03}
feeling about this, but{03}
we have to give it a shot{75}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002989}
{01}{0a}Oh dear. I doubt we can do{03}
much, but I'd rather avert{03}
certain doom, thank you.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000298c}
{01}{00}
------------------
{0000298f}
{01}{01}I see. Well, I'm not sure{03}
if we can do this, but we{03}
will give it a shot{75}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002992}
{01}{07}I cannot thank you enough.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002995}
{01}{07}Are you hurt{76} Please don't{03}
overexert yourselves.{02}
You're the only hope my{03}
father has to end his{03}
obsession with the demon.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002998}
{01}{07}Are you all right{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000299b}
{01}{07}My father should be on the{03}
4th floor.{02}
A sentry of stone in statue{03}
shape blocks the entrance,{02}
and cannot be passed{03}
without permission.{02}
However... going through{03}
the arena will also lead you{03}
to a path to his chamber.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{0000299e}
Jambon is here. He's in{03}
high spirits as usual.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029a1}
{01}{04}What're you doing{76}{03}
Stop{75}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000029a4}
{01}{04}In the dungeon on the{03}
island far to the south,{02}
I hear there is a man held{03}
there dressed as oddly as{03}
you all are.{02}
Have you met him{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000029a7}
The old woman before you is{03}
small, but surprisingly{03}
dignified.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029aa}
{01}{13}Oh Jambon, you're safely{03}
home once more.{02}
They said the guards caught{03}
you, but I'm glad you're{03}
unharmed.{02}
And you, stranger. I must{03}
thank you for rescuing my{03}
apprentice here.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000029ad}
{01}{04}Thanks. Here is where we{03}
part ways.{02}
Oh, and if you search the{03}
stable on the eastern wing{03}
of the floor,{02}
you'll find something good{03}
hidden in the straw. It's{03}
my gift to you.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000029b0}
{01}{13}Jambon won't shut up{03}
about his rescue. Thanks.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000029b3}
{01}{13}{04}{00}
------------------
{000029b6}
{01}{13}Quit jerking around.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000029b9}
{01}{13}Don't make me worry.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{000029bc}
There's a small boat tied{03}
to a pier to the south.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029bf}
A small boat is tied to{03}
the old pier.{03}
Shall I get on it{76}{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029c2}
Where should I go{76}{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029c5}
I let the current take the{03}
boat, and end up at a most{03}
curious destination.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029c8}
This is a menagerie where{03}
monsters created by Master{03}
Laplace are gathered.{02}
You should go see it if{03}
you're interested.{02}
If properly tamed perhaps{03}
you will be able to talk to{03}
them and learn something.{02}
But be cautious{a2} these{03}
monsters are rare and{03}
irreplaceable.{02}
If you kill them that's{03}
the end for them.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029cb}
A strange plant brandishing{03}
ivy attacked{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029ce}
There's a green skinned{03}
monster holding a club.{02}
It notices us, howls, and{03}
starts shaking its club.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029d1}
One passageway on the 4th{03}
floor was made invisible.{02}
It's only for King Laplace,{03}
and anyone else who used it{03}
never returned.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029d4}
A happy looking girl with{03}
green skin keeps looking at{03}
me and laughing.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029d7}
Dyiiing Tiiime.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029da}
Princess Cassandra is in a{03}
jail cell.{02}
The cell is guarded by a{03}
fierce creature that uses{03}
strange powers.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029dd}
There is a white horse with{03}
a horn growing out of its{03}
forehead. A unicorn{75}{02}
I start to smile when I see{03}
it, and it approaches me.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029e0}
You are not people of this{03}
world. Leave quickly before{03}
you lose your lives.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029e3}
There's a green skinned{03}
giant with sharp claws.{02}
He sees me and stands up,{03}
and starts coming my way.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029e6}
I hear that somewhere on{03}
the 4th floor there is an{03}
Elder Sign.{02}
... that passes through to{03}
the world where the Demon{03}
of Laplace hides.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029e9}
A radiant woman with bird{03}
wings is singing beautiful{03}
music.{02}
I cry out in applause, but{03}
she reacts coldly, and keeps{03}
on performing.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029ec}
What do you want{76}{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029ef}
I saw Princess Cassandra{03}
on one of the small islands{03}
to the north.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029f2}
There's a huge chicken with{03}
the tail of a snake.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029f5}
Letting out a single cry,{03}
the cockatrice attacks.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029f8}
There's a wolf that stands{03}
on two legs.{02}
When he notices me, he{03}
suddenly becomes very{03}
defensive.{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029fb}
You suspicious person{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{000029fe}
Do you know a wizard named{03}
Moldiv{76} He turned me into{03}
this.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a01}
There is a caveman holding{03}
a huge stone axe.{02}
He sees us and approaches{03}
cautiously.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a04}
I was made to help kill a{03}
king named Laplace.{02}
Benedict, my master, and a{03}
wizard from the undercroft,{03}
used me in their schemes.{02}
When their plans failed,{03}
Benedict went somewhere,{03}
but I came here.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a07}
{01}{10}You guys sneaking around{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a0a}
{01}{10}I just want to warn you{03}
that the river to the west{03}
is the actual River Styx.{02}
Do not swim in it.{03}
You will die.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a0d}
{01}{10}Leading the way out{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a10}
{01}{10}Saying goodbye{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a13}
This book looks interesting{03}
enough for me to have a{03}
look at it.{02}
The mythos that burns my{03}
mind also makes it feel{03}
better.{02}
Learned {79}Heal the Body{7a}{03}
invocation.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a16}
{01}{07}My father didn't let go of{03}
the Demon{a8} as I expected.{02}
But at least he's given up{03}
on invading your world.{02}
For that I am glad.{02}
My ills are all that{03}
remain now. Please return{03}
to your own world.{02}
You have my blessings.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a19}
{01}{07}Please return to your own{03}
world quickly before the{03}
Elder Sign closes{75}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a1c}
It's here now.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a1f}
{01}{0d}{04}{00}
------------------
{00002a22}
{01}{0c}Are you returning to your{03}
own world now{76}{02}
I must stay here and look{03}
for my sister.{02}
I will be waiting next to{03}
the Elder Sign, so please{03}
come back soon.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a25}
{01}{04}Going back to your own{03}
world then, {04}{00}
------------------
{00002a28}
{01}{0f}You're heading back to{03}
town{76}{02}
I'll wait here next to the{03}
Elder Sign and keep my eyes{03}
peeled til you get back.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a2b}
{01}{0b}You're returning to your{03}
world{76}{02}
Well then, I'll be waiting{03}
next to the Elder Sign.{02}
I don't know what Moldiv{03}
going to do, so I can't{03}
leave this world.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a2e}
{01}{10}You're going back to your{03}
own world{76}{02}
Well then, I'll be waiting{03}
next to the pentagram.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a31}
I unlocked it.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a34}
I insert the crystal into{03}
the slot.{02}
A door very silently opens{03}
on a nearby wall.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a37}
The old skull is put into{03}
place above the door.{02}
The eyes shine and the lock{03}
unlocks with a click.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a3a}
I insert the jeweled scarab{03}
into the small depression,{03}
and the door opens{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a3d}
The hidden door remains{03}
open.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a40}
A guard. He's attacking{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a43}
The Elder Sign is closed.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a46}
There's a lizard monster{03}
that stands on two legs.{02}
He looks rather surprised{03}
to see me.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a49}
Letting out a scream, the{03}
Lizardman attacks.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a4c}
{01}{10}You're the ones the guard{03}
is chasing.{02}
Don't worry, I won't call{03}
him here.{02}
I'm not friends enough with{03}
him to help him out.{02}
But anyway, go quickly.{02}
There are lots of guards{03}
wandering around{03}
everywhere...{02}
... except here and the{03}
witch's shack. You should{03}
be careful.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a4f}
No sooner had he finished{03}
speaking than a guard just{03}
showed up out of the blue.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a52}
{01}{10}According to rumor he's{03}
already been here.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a55}
Friends of Benedict{75}{03}
Shut up and die{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a58}
Only commands from the{03}
king's family...{02}
... work on the stone{03}
statue guarding the king's{03}
chambers.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a5b}
There've been rumors about{03}
the wizard Louvain, that{03}
he's not human.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a5e}
If it isn't Jambon. He{03}
sees me and is coming this{03}
way.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a61}
{01}{04}Princess Cassandra awaits.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a64}
It's the witch of the lake.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a67}
{01}{13}You're back. Good. You'll{03}
find the Princess inside.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a6a}
{01}{13}I scrounged up as much good{03}
stuff as I could manage.{02}
The left exit to the north{03}
leads to Jambon's shop.{02}
The right exit is where the{03}
weary can find some respite.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a6d}
{01}{13}What do you need from me{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a70}
A woman of great beauty is{03}
standing before me.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a73}
{01}{07}{04}{00}
------------------
{00002a76}
{01}{07}{04}{00}
------------------
{00002a79}
It seems Benedict is hiding{03}
beneath the castle.{02}
But the guards my father{03}
dispatched, in thrall to{03}
his paranoia, are now{02}
blocking the entrance to{03}
the undercroft.{02}
My father is deeply{03}
afraid, and is doubting his{03}
own station.{02}
If we try now...{02}
... we may be able to{03}
persuade him to relinquish{03}
the power of the demon.{02}
Please take him this letter{03}
and persuade him of the{03}
error of his ways.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a7c}
Princess's Letter received.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a7f}
{01}{07}Long ago, my father was{03}
just a mathematician.{02}
But something changed when{03}
he conceived of the demon,{02}
of the power to sell all{03}
futures and to choose the{03}
one you wish...{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a82}
{01}{07}I don't see Bayard. What{03}
happened{76}{02}
{01} {04}{00}
------------------
{00002a85}
{01}{07}You need my father's{03}
permission to enter his{03}
room. I can help.{02}
I get the feeling that if I{03}
run away now I'll...{02}
I'll never see my father{03}
again...{02}
{01} Cassandra joined.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a88}
Jambon's here.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a8b}
{01}{04}This is Jambon's tool{03}
shop. Need something{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002a8e}
This looks like a bedroom.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a91}
As I arrive at Laplace{03}
Castle, I'm surrounded{03}
by Guards.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a94}
Fools from another world{03}
here to try and kill our{03}
Lord and Master, Laplace.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a97}
More of Benedict's puppets.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a9a}
Just hand over Louvain{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002a9d}
The guards now move in to{03}
attack.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002aa0}
Suddenly a man's shouting{03}
pierced the carnage.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002aa3}
{01}{0b}Fly, you fools{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002aa6}
{01}{0b}{04}{00}
------------------
{00002aa9}
{01}{00}
------------------
{00002aac}
{01}{01}That voice... Adolph{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002aaf}
{01}{0b}Hurry{75}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002ab2}
The voice grew faint.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002ab5}
The Elder Sign's power has{03}
been sealed away. You can't{03}
return to Newcam that way{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002ab8}
{01}{03}
Seems Benedict's seal on{03}
the Elder Sign is{03}
impossible to break.{02}
We're trapped here.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002abb}
{01}{0a}Benedict's seal on the{03}
Elder Sign is beyond our{03}
ability to undo.{02}
We're trapped here. Shit.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002abe}
{01}{09}Oh no, I can't return{03}
to Newcam{75}{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002ac1}
{01}{01}Oh no{75} We can't return{03}
to Newcam{75}{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002ac4}
{01}{02}
Well, we can go{a2} forward,{03}
forward, or... forward.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002ac7}
{01}{00}
------------------
{00002aca}
Guards are coming up the{03}
southern staircase one{03}
after the other.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002acd}
A familiar voice calls out.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002ad0}
{01}{0b}Hurry{75} You must take the{03}
northern staircase and flee{03}
to the floor above{75}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002ad3}
{01}{0b}Go through the door{75}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002ad6}
Some power seals the way,{03}
and it seems to be rather{03}
impenetrable to entry.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002ad9}
The wizard turns to me.{02}
{01}{0b}In you I see this world's{03}
last hope, so I in turn{03}
shall aid you.{02}
See Princess Cassandra who{03}
is with the witch of the{03}
lake.{02}
For now, let us be off to{03}
the courtyard to the south.{02}
{01} His spell takes us there.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002adc}
Adolph's standing here.{02}
{01}{0b}{04}{00}
------------------
{00002adf}
There is a sighing woman{03}
here.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002ae2}
Letting out a scream,{03}
the woman ran off.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002ae5}
The guards won't follow{03}
you all the way here.{03}
I hope Adolph's safe too.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002ae8}
Hurry, go see Princess{03}
Cassandra.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002aeb}
Letting out a scream,{03}
the man ran off.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002aee}
I've seen Louvain emerge{03}
from the Elder Sign on the{03}
1st floor.{02}
But the Signs were sealed{03}
by Master Laplace,{02}
so nobody should be able to{03}
pass through them{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002af1}
This room is warm,{03}
and full of moisture.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002af4}
A dark stain spreads out{03}
over the floor.{02}
A horrible stench hangs{03}
over the area.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002af7}
A neat looking knife with{03}
a wavy, undulating blade.{02}
Javanese Kris Knife{03}
acquired.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002afa}
Uh{7d}oh, company.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002afd}
{01}{0d}{04}{00}
------------------
{00002b00}
{01}{0d}{04}{00}
------------------
{00002b03}
{01}{03}
Bayard, do you know where{03}
Benedict is{76}{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002b06}
{01}{0d}Sir Kenichiro, Benedict's{03}
whereabouts remain unknown{03}
to me..{02}
But I would venture to{03}
guess he's hiding with{03}
Louvain beneath the castle.{02}
But we are ill prepared to{03}
go there in this state. Let{03}
us seek safety for now.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002b09}
The Elder Sign is sealed.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002b0c}
I see a guard, and he sees{03}
me as well. He raises his{03}
weapon and attacks{75}{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002b0f}
The hidden door still lies{03}
open.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002b12}
Inside the treasure chest{03}
is a metal emitting a{03}
mysterious glow.{02}
{00}
------------------
{00002b15}
{01}{05}Adamantium, a mythic metal.{03}
We can use this to craft{03}
machine parts.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002b18}
{01}{00}
------------------
{00002b1b}
{01}{01}This is Adamantium. It{03}
looks like we can use it{03}
for machine parts.{02}
{01} {00}
------------------
{00002b1e}
Rarest Adamantium{03}
acquired.{02}
{00}
------------------
